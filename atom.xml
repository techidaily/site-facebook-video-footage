It gives good support to the downloaded YouTube videos (usually in FLV or MP4 format). You can either click “Import” on the primary windows and select YouTube video files from your computer, or simply drag and drop YouTube video files from File Explorer to the User’s Album.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-import-options.jpg"                      alt="import source media in Filmora9"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Drag-and-drop-YouTube-videos-to-merge"><a href="#Step-2-Drag-and-drop-YouTube-videos-to-merge" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.

All YouTube files will join one after another without interrupts and there is none transition by default, but you can add transitions between video clips as you want.

To do so, switch to Transition tab, and drag the desired transition to the Timeline. Alternatively, right click any transition and choose “Apply to All” and “Random to All” from the popup menu to add transitions between YouTube videos in seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transition-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="add transition in Filmora9"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Merge-multiple-YouTube-files-into-one"><a href="#Step-4-Merge-multiple-YouTube-files-into-one" class="headerlink" title="Step 4.

You can click Play button to preview how YouTube videos will be merged. If the result is good, click “Export” button to save the YouTube video as one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg"                      alt="export in Filmora9"                ></p><p>Therefore, go to the “Format” tab and select one desired format and click Create to start merging YouTube videos.

It enables users to make minor edits to videos they’ve uploaded onto YouTube, as well as merge several clips together into one. It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe’s Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/youtube-downloader/find-videos.jpg"                      alt="import video"                ></p><h5 id="Get-access-to-the-editor"><a href="#Get-access-to-the-editor" class="headerlink" title="Get access to the editor"></a>Get access to the editor</h5><p>Sign in to your YouTube (or Google) account.

For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.</p><p>My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg"                      alt="Become YouTube Partner should be easier"                ></p><p><em>I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those.</em></p><p>However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.</p><h4 id="1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number"><a href="#1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number" class="headerlink" title="1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number"></a>1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number</h4><p>This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.</p><p>Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).</p><p>If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.</p><h4 id="2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money"><a href="#2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money" class="headerlink" title="2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money"></a>2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg"                      alt="the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube"                ></p><p><em>Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight.</em></p><p>How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.</p><p>You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.</p><p>It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.</p><h4 id="3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized"><a href="#3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized" class="headerlink" title="3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized"></a>3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized</h4><p>YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.</p><p>Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process. Channels with content that violates YouTube’s Community Guidelines can be barred from monetization.</p><h4 id="4-Thieves-won’t-profit"><a href="#4-Thieves-won’t-profit" class="headerlink" title="4. Thieves won’t profit"></a>4. Thieves won’t profit</h4><p>There are people out there who want views, subscribers, and nice comments but who do not want to put any real work into getting them. It isn’t uncommon for someone like this to download a video they like and post it to their own channel.</p><p>This reposted video will steal views and ad revenue away from the real post on the creator’s channel.</p><p>Having a review process for the Partnership Program will help ensure that these content thieves are caught before they can make any money.</p><p>YouTube also recently made it easier to report users for impersonation, regardless of how many views they have.</p><p><em>TheGamingGuy looked into people who had stolen his logo and found out they had also stolen whole videos from other YouTubers.</em></p><p>There are clear benefits to this new milestone, but there are also some questions remaining.</p><h2 id="How-does-this-change-stop-content-thieves-from-taking-views-and-ad-revenue-from-creators"><a href="#How-does-this-change-stop-content-thieves-from-taking-views-and-ad-revenue-from-creators" class="headerlink" title="How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?"></a>How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?</h2><p>It will help stop them from making money themselves, but not from siphoning away views from other channels. The impersonation rules only apply if somebody is pretending to be another creator. You can steal and repost someone’s content without pretending to be them.</p><p>This new rule does take away money as an incentive for stealing content, but a lot of people doing this probably aren’t in it for the money. They might just be misguided fans who want to repost videos they enjoy.</p><h2 id="Could-this-affect-your-CPM"><a href="#Could-this-affect-your-CPM" class="headerlink" title="Could this affect your CPM?"></a>Could this affect your CPM?</h2><p>Competition plays a huge role in how much YouTubers earn from ad revenue. Some genres are bigger on YouTube than others and, the more popular your genre is, the more options advertisers have. The more competition there is for higher-paying ads, the larger your channel has to be to get them.</p><p>Could this new milestone decrease competition in some genres?</p><p>Leave a comment to let me know what you think.

However, for almost all YouTubers, their mind will soon turn to whether they can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make money from YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how much they could be making.</p><p>If you’re curious about how much money you could make from your channel, or just want to see what the potential is for creating a revenue stream once you’ve built your audience, we’ve got just the thing for you. We’ve developed this YouTube Money Calculator, a simple tool that lets you see at a glance how much you could be earning from your videos and channel. And we will also introduce some YouTube Money Calculator alternatives to you.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: What is a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part6"><strong>Part 6: Making Money on YouTube</strong></a></li></ul><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Complete Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Let’s take a look at the YouTube Money Calculator now and explore your potential for generating income from your passion for YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-a-CPM-and-How-Do-YouTube-Money-Calculators-Average-It-Out"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-a-CPM-and-How-Do-YouTube-Money-Calculators-Average-It-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?"></a>Part 1: What’s a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?</h2><p>CPM stands for ‘cost per mille&#x2F;thousand’ and is the price of a thousand ad impressions (to the advertiser. For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).</p><p>YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.</p><p>However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator"></a>Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator</h2><p>The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.</p><p>If you don’t know your CPM yet, don’t worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let’s take a look:</p><ul><li><a href="#videos">1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</a></li><li><a href="#channel">2.

Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos"></a>1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</h3><p>To use YouTube Money Calculator to get an estimated calculation of your revenue for a single video, simply set the number of views you get per day (or hope to get) and the CPM rates. If you don’t know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.</p><p>From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.</p><p>If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.</p><h3 id="2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel"><a href="#2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel"></a>2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel</h3><p>If you’d like a more complete view of your YouTube earnings potential, why not investigate the revenue possibilities for the whole channel? Simply paste your channel link into the box and our tool will estimate how much you could be earning if you monetize that channel.</p><p>As well as showing this, the tool will show all sorts of other useful information such as number of total views, number of subscribers, number of uploaded videos and even your country and category. It’s a great place to start to evaluate your efforts and to get a realistic idea of what your earnings could be.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives"></a>Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives</h2><p>Some of the best YouTube Money Calculator alternatives available are:</p><ul><li><a href="#social"><strong>Social Blade</strong></a></li><li><a href="#influencer"><strong>Influencer Marketing Hub</strong></a></li></ul><h3 id="1-How-Social-Blade-Calculates-YouTube-Money"><a href="#1-How-Social-Blade-Calculates-YouTube-Money" class="headerlink" title="1.

Users need only type in the name of the channel they are interested in and Social Blade will deliver all kinds of information about that channel, like how many subscribers and views it received in the last 30 days. It will also include estimates of monthly and yearly earnings. The revenue results are adjusted based off of the overall size of the channel and the total number of views that they receive each day. You can even scroll down for estimates of daily earnings listed by date.</p><h3 id="2-How-Influencer-Marketing-Hub-Calculates-YouTube-Money"><a href="#2-How-Influencer-Marketing-Hub-Calculates-YouTube-Money" class="headerlink" title="2.

How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money</h3><p>Influencer Marketing Hub is almost like an active infographic that allows a user to very quickly adjust sliders based on the daily video views, active engagement, views per month, and views per year.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated"><a href="#Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?"></a>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</h2><p>YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p><p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p><p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p><p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p><p>But that’s not the whole story.</p><p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p><p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p><p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform"></a>Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform</h2><p>If you’ve had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you’ll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here’s how:</p><pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment</code></pre><p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email.

SocialBlade.com is a free-to-use website that displays your YouTube statistics – or the stats of any channel you are interested in – using an intuitive layout.</p><p>While many of the stats you can find on Social Blade are also available right on YouTube, some people find it easier to read on Social Blade. YouTube provides you with a lot of information, and a lot of it might not be useful to all creators.</p><ol><li><a href="#yourstats"><strong>Your YouTube Analytics</strong></a></li><li><a href="#spy"><strong>Spying on Other Channels</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Your-YouTube-Analytics"><a href="#Your-YouTube-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="Your YouTube Analytics"></a>Your YouTube Analytics</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-blade-youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="Social Blade for YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>Social Blade is an excellent place to gauge the growth of your channel. It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.</p><p>To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.</p><p>On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.</p><p>First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.</p><p>Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.</p><p>On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.</p><p>The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.</p><p>If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.</p><p>By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.</p><h2 id="Spying-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Spying-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Spying on Other Channels"></a>Spying on Other Channels</h2><p>When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar. If you want to use Social Blade to monitor somebody else’s stats, type their channel name instead.</p><p>By looking up your direct competitors (channels about the same size as yours within your same genre) you will be able to see which of their videos are performing best for them when you combine the daily information Social Blade provides with your knowledge of what videos they posted when.</p><p>Knowing what is working for your rivals will help you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >design your content strategy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You can also use Social Blade to look up huge YouTube stars who you admire, just to see how well they are doing. Take their estimated revenue with a grain of salt, though – it’s just an estimate.</p><p> That’s how you can use Social Blade for YouTube - have you ever used it?</p><h2 id="Make-Your-Videos-Stand-Out-with-Powerful-Video-Editor"><a href="#Make-Your-Videos-Stand-Out-with-Powerful-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Videos Stand Out with Powerful Video Editor"></a>Make Your Videos Stand Out with Powerful Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-list-of-8-real-world-youtube-boosters/"><u>[New] The Ultimate List of 8 Real-World YouTube Boosters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/in-2024-youtubes-income-leap-at-500-subs-count/"><u>In 2024, YouTube's Income Leap at 500 Subs Count</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-download-free-sound-effects-for-youtubers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Download Free Sound Effects for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-access-unlimited-stock-photos-via-four-noteworthy-youtubes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Access Unlimited Stock Photos via Four Noteworthy YouTubes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-understanding-what-makes-asmr-videos-special/"><u>[New] Understanding What Makes ASMR Videos Special</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-channeling-success-the-personal-brand-strategy-for-youtubers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Channeling Success  The Personal Brand Strategy for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/sourav-joshis-roadmap-to-financial-freedom-via-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Sourav Joshi's Roadmap to Financial Freedom via YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-writers-guide-embedding-images-in-articles-without-spending/"><u>[Updated] Writers' Guide  Embedding Images in Articles Without Spending</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-install-the-latest-ios-beta-version-on-apple-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Install the Latest iOS Beta Version on Apple iPhone 15?

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it. The little information that is available indicates that not everyone is capable of having an autonomous sensory meridian response to audio or visual stimuli. Furthermore, the potential triggers vary from whispering to watching someone prepare food, which contributes to the mystery surrounding the phenomenon.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you develop a better understanding of ASMR.

That is how YouTube works for you. This article is about how YouTube works technically. There are a lot of steps which occur between you clicking ‘upload’ and a viewer clicking ‘play’. Understanding this process can be useful to YouTubers because it can help shed light on where problems may be occurring when you have issues uploading or watching videos. Generally when there is a problem it is on your end and there are multiple simple things you can do to fix it.</p><p>This article will explain what goes on behind the scenes when you upload a video, where that video really goes, and what happens when somebody clicks play.</p><h2 id="How-Does-YouTube-Work"><a href="#How-Does-YouTube-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does YouTube Work"></a>How Does YouTube Work</h2><h4 id="1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload"><a href="#1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens When You Upload?"></a>1. What Happens When You Upload?</h4><p>When you upload a video your computer or device packages it into IP packets. Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube. The packets are encoded into radio signals which are sent through a wifi or cellular network. Your video travels through switches and routers on the internet until they reach YouTube’s servers. Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router. If your uploads are taking too long consider compressing your videos before you upload them. You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored" class="headerlink" title="2. Where is Your Video Stored?"></a>2. Where is Your Video Stored?</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-works.JPG"                      alt="how youtube works"                ></p><p>As it is owned by Google YouTube uses Google’s ‘Bigtable’, a compressed data storage system which allows it to store the 500+ hours of video uploaded to its servers every minute. Bigtable is software, though, not hardware. YouTube and Google both have massive amounts of data and it needs to be physically housed somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videos-uploaded-to-youtube.jpg"                      alt="videos uploaded to youtube"                ></p><p>Google has Modular Data Centers all over the world where it keeps its servers. These centers could cost as much as $600 million dollars each and consume huge amounts of electricity. There are six of them in the United States, three in Europe, two in Asia, and one is South America.</p><h4 id="3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video"><a href="#3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-clip-narration-devisee/"><u>[New] In 2024, Clip Narration Devisee</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-taggification-top-7-affordable-online-extractors-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Taggification  Top 7 Affordable Online Extractors for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-guide-to-the-best-bridal-films-8-from-youtube-plus-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Guide to the Best Bridal Films (8 From YouTube + Vimeo)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-delving-into-youtubes-functionality-after-upload-for-2024/"><u>[New] Delving Into YouTube's Functionality After Upload for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-best-10-screen-recorders-for-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best 10 Screen Recorders for YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-conquering-green-hue-fixing-it-on-mac-for-video-editors/"><u>[New] In 2024, Conquering Green Hue  Fixing It On Mac For Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-concluding-your-channel-on-youtube-expert-guides-and-templates-for-2024/"><u>[New] Concluding Your Channel on YouTube - Expert Guides & Templates for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-softening-edges-strategic-lighting-for-content-creators/"><u>[Updated] Softening Edges  Strategic Lighting for Content Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-insights-on-asmr-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Insights on ASMR Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-the-soloists-journey-personal-growth-and-success-on-youtube-for-musicians/"><u>[New] The Soloist's Journey  Personal Growth and Success on YouTube for Musicians</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-passcode-4-easy-methods-with-or-without-itunes-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Passcode 4 Easy Methods (With or Without iTunes)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/looking-for-a-location-changer-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-look-no-further-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Looking For A Location Changer On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?

It is easier to grow your channel if you focus on a niche (i.e. camera equipment or makeup) you are particularly knowledgeable about.</p><ul><li><a href="#affiliatelinks">Affiliate Links</a></li><li><a href="#freeproducts">Getting Products for Free</a></li><li><a href="#filming">Filming the Video</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links"></a>Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links</h3><p>One of the main ways you can make money doing reviews is through affiliate links. When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:</p><h4 id="1-JVZoo"><a href="#1-JVZoo" class="headerlink" title="1. JVZoo"></a>1. JVZoo</h4><p>You can find high end products for about $5 to $10. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).</p><h4 id="2-Click-Bank"><a href="#2-Click-Bank" class="headerlink" title="2. Click Bank"></a>2. Click Bank</h4><p>You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.</p><h4 id="3-Warrior-Plus"><a href="#3-Warrior-Plus" class="headerlink" title="3. Warrior Plus"></a>3. Warrior Plus</h4><p>This is a highly renowned affiliate program. It very similar to JVZoo.</p><h4 id="4-Amazon"><a href="#4-Amazon" class="headerlink" title="4. Amazon"></a>4. Amazon</h4><p>It doesn’t get any better than Amazon. You can find just about anything.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Getting Products for Free"></a>Part 2:  Getting Products for Free</h3><p>Once you’ve built up authority as a reviewer, brands will start giving you free stuff to review. Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.</p><p>Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote&#x2F;review products you already have opinions on.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:  Filming the Video"></a>Part 3:  Filming the Video</h3><p>Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.</p><p>That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review. So long as you are honest in your opinions, and open with your viewers about any relationships you have with brands, you are not ‘selling out’.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>It takes time to earn any money reviewing products on YouTube. However, once you are an established authority in your niche, brands might start coming to you on their own.</p><p>If you were going to be paid to review products on YouTube, what kinds of products would they be? And if you want to make the reviewing video better, you should use a video editing software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-transcription-aid-for-your-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Transcription Aid for Your YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-pioneering-proficiency-the-complete-guide-to-music-and-media-fusion-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Pioneering Proficiency  The Complete Guide to Music & Media Fusion on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/skyrocket-views-implementing-these-proven-youtube-growth-methods-for-2024/"><u>Skyrocket Views  Implementing These Proven YouTube Growth Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-from-genres-to-gems-building-a-personalized-youtube-music-mix-onlinemobile/"><u>[Updated] From Genres to Gems  Building a Personalized YouTube Music Mix Online/Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-what-lies-beneath-an-exploration-into-youtubes-unlisted-video-space/"><u>[Updated] What Lies Beneath  An Exploration Into YouTube's Unlisted Video Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-explore-the-best-8-mirrorless-cameras-for-youtube-vloggers/"><u>[Updated] Explore the Best  8 Mirrorless Cameras for YouTube Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-diy-split-screen-video-tutorials-for-youtube-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  DIY Split-Screen Video Tutorials for YouTube Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-the-power-of-first-impressions-with-top-30-youtube-intra-craftsmen/"><u>[Updated] Unleash the Power of First Impressions with Top 30 YouTube Intra Craftsmen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-youtube-content-via-finalcut-pro-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing YouTube Content via FinalCut Pro Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-amplify-videographic-excellence-choose-from-these-7-audios-for-2024/"><u>[New] Amplify Videographic Excellence - Choose From These 7 Audios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-on-motorola-edge-40-neo-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What is Geo-Blocking and How to Bypass it On Motorola Edge 40 Neo?

If your dream is to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it’s important to remember that regular people are doing it.</p><p>Jesse Ridgway is the owner of the vlog <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/McJuggerNuggets" >McJuggerNuggets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has grown to over 3.4 million subscribers. He makes enough money to live off of YouTube alone. Here is a case study of how he made his first $10,000 on YouTube:</p><h2 id="Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets"><a href="#Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets" class="headerlink" title="Case Study of McJuggerNuggets"></a>Case Study of McJuggerNuggets</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/case-study-mcjugger-nuggets.jpg"                      alt="Case Study McJugger Nuggets"                ></p><p>Jesse was one of the earliest YouTubers. He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense"><a href="#AdSense" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.</p><p>More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.</p><h4 id="Target-the-Right-Demographic"><a href="#Target-the-Right-Demographic" class="headerlink" title="Target the Right Demographic"></a>Target the Right Demographic</h4><p>Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically. Think about who you want your audience to be and make videos that will appeal to them.</p><h4 id="Multichannel-Networks"><a href="#Multichannel-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Multichannel Networks"></a>Multichannel Networks</h4><p>Once you hit a certain level of subscribership and views you will start getting invited to MCMs. In some cases, multichannel network promotions could entitle you to discounts on merchandise and products. Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.</p><h4 id="Social-Blade"><a href="#Social-Blade" class="headerlink" title="Social Blade"></a>Social Blade</h4><p>This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more. It will give you a good impression of what you should be including in your videos and how you can make more money from your channel.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time"></a>Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time</h4><p>Uploading videos at the right time will make sure that you are on the front page of recently uploaded videos when people are let out of school or taking a break from work. This will earn you lots of views. Set an upload time for all of your videos each day and stick to that schedule.</p><h4 id="Check-out-Webinars"><a href="#Check-out-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Check out Webinars"></a>Check out Webinars</h4><p>Looking into webinars and videos of what other popular YouTube experts have done will help you model their success.</p><h4 id="Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers"><a href="#Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="Collaborate with Other YouTubers"></a>Collaborate with Other YouTubers</h4><p>When you create a collab video you and your partner are each introduced to each other’s subscribers.</p><h4 id="Keep-Quality-Up"><a href="#Keep-Quality-Up" class="headerlink" title="Keep Quality Up"></a>Keep Quality Up</h4><p>Putting time and effort into every upload will ensure that you won’t lose subscribers or viewers because you got a bit lazy.</p><h4 id="Do-Follow-Up-Videos"><a href="#Do-Follow-Up-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Do Follow-Up Videos"></a>Do Follow-Up Videos</h4><p>If you have a particular video that has a lot of views, you may want to consider creating follow-up videos. This can be a great way to generate lots of views.</p><h4 id="Complete-Regular-Research"><a href="#Complete-Regular-Research" class="headerlink" title="Complete Regular Research"></a>Complete Regular Research</h4><p>Regular research into your target market will help you to create the trendiest new content.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Get-Discouraged"><a href="#Don’t-Get-Discouraged" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Get Discouraged"></a>Don’t Get Discouraged</h4><p>Timing and luck are definitely two of the biggest factors in becoming a success on YouTube.

Won’t YouTube ban your account?</p><p>Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</p><p>Buying views isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules (it is against the spirit of the rules and can still get you in trouble), depending on how you do it (in general: buying real-people views is technically not against the rules and buying bot views is definitely against them).

These sites either cannot really deliver on the time frame they promise or are not providing ‘real’ views. They may be using bots that generate a large number of fake views quickly, which can be dangerous for your channel.</p><p>What you want are high retention views from real humans. Quality services, like the ones listed below, will have real people watch your videos (or at least play them all the way through while they do other things). A good turnaround period for 1 million YouTube views is between 6 and 8 months. A waiting period of a few months is necessary if you want viewer retention.</p><p>Viewer retention means someone is actually watching your video, not just clicking on it and clicking away (which is bad for your search engine ranking). Beware that almost all view buying sites will claim to sell high retention views regardless of if they do or not.</p><p>Trustworthy services often have other services available, such as Social Promotion on other social media platforms or YouTube likes and comments. These will help to encourage more organic views, likes, and comments. Also, if your views go up but you have no likes or comments then that might tip people off that you’ve bought views and while it is not against the rules there is certainly a stigma attached.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that while buying human views is not technically against YouTube’s rules and can be done safely, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying subscribers is more dangerous <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/everything-you-need-to-know--how-to-buy-youtube-views-292.html" >For even more information on buying views, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Where-To-Buy-1-Million-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Where-To-Buy-1-Million-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views"></a><strong>Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="http://buyviewsreview.com/" >BuyViewsReview <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a site dedicated to helping you avoid scams that can hurt your channel. They test companies that sell views to make sure they can deliver on their promises safely. It really pays off to spend some time there and learn about the <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/don%E2%80%99t-get-scammed--buy-safe-youtube-views-from-top-providers-290.html" >view selling industry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before you jump in and start spending money.</p><p>Here are BuyViewsReveiew’s top 3 trusted providers from whom you can buy 1 million YouTube views safely:</p><p> <strong>#1: Devumi:</strong></p><p>Devumi offers a 100% money-back guarantee, which should be a given for these kinds of services. They have a reasonable completion time of an average of 3 to 4 months for most orders, and you can stake advantage of the video SEO service for free. According to BuyViewsReview’s test, their customer service is excellent.</p><p>You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $3,497 on Devumi.</p><p> <strong>#2: BuyViews:</strong></p><p>BuyViews is another option when you’re trying to reach 1 million views on YouTube. Offering a 100% money-back guarantee just like Devumi, BuyViews’ average time of completion is slightly lower. With this service, you can also buy likes and comments or take advantage of their social promotion options.</p><p>You can buy 1 million views for $4,000 on BuyViews, which is slightly more than Devumi’s price.</p><p> <strong>#3: FastFollowerz:</strong></p><p>FastFollowersz also offers a 100% money-back guarantee. They are able to deliver on their promises, but they are in the number 3 slot because they are not totally safe – 2&#x2F;5 videos in BuyViewsReviews’ test of this service were taken down by YouTube. It also seems like the views they offer are low retention, which can hurt your channel even if your videos don’t get removed.</p><p>You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $2,800 on FastFollowerz, which is significantly less than the two higher-ranked options.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-buy-youtube-subscribers-hundreds-of-subscribers-for-5/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Buy YouTube Subscribers - Hundreds of Subscribers for $5?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-impact-a-guide-to-customizing-game-banners/"><u>[New] Maximizing Impact  A Guide to Customizing Game Banners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-design-strategies-for-top-tier-valorant-thumbnails-on-social-media-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Design Strategies for Top-Tier Valorant Thumbnails on Social Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/youtubes-finest-ranked-by-skyrocketing-subscriber-numbers-for-2024/"><u>YouTube's Finest  Ranked by Skyrocketing Subscriber Numbers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/the-definitive-guide-to-proportion-perfection-in-youtube-for-2024/"><u>The Definitive Guide to Proportion Perfection in YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-roundup-of-platforms-for-video-intro-acquisition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Expert Roundup of Platforms for Video Intro Acquisition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-balancing-creativity-and-monetization-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Balancing Creativity and Monetization in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-best-practices-choosing-youtubes-most-popular-video-formats-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Practices  Choosing YouTube's Most Popular Video Formats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-spark-inspiration-free-soundtracks-to-enhance-projects/"><u>[New] Spark Inspiration - Free Soundtracks to Enhance Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/6-essential-tools-for-making-epic-movie-introduction-videos/"><u>6 Essential Tools for Making Epic Movie Introduction Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premium-vfx-setup-options/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Premium VFX Setup Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-acclaimed-editing-software-for-virtual-recordings/"><u>[New] Acclaimed Editing Software for Virtual Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-list-of-e-commerce-sites-for-one-of-a-kind-boxed-gifts/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive List of E-Commerce Sites for One-of-a-Kind Boxed Gifts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/slowing-down-reality-crafting-slow-motion-videos-from-still-images-online-for-2024/"><u>Slowing Down Reality  Crafting Slow Motion Videos From Still Images Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comparing-instagrams-latest-features-reels-vs-stories/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Comparing Instagram's Latest Features  Reels Vs Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-mastery-the-ultimate-animoji-guide-for-iphone-x-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unveiling Mastery  The Ultimate Animoji Guide for iPhone X for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-vocal-variety-techniques-for-modulating-tone-and-pitch/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Vocal Variety Techniques for Modulating Tone and Pitch</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p><p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p><h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p><p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p><h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p><h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p><h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p><h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p><p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p><h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p><p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p><p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p><p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p><p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p><h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

Even the name of the file you’re uploading to your channel should contain a keyword, and once the upload is completed you should add a title, description, and metadata if you would like to increase the video’s visibility on the platform. It is vital to select your YouTube SEO strategy before you actually start adding new videos to your strategy.

A small thing like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adding a thumbnail to a YouTube video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can increase both the number of views and the number of likes that video is getting. In addition, YouTube’s video editor enables you to <strong>add end screens</strong> that last anywhere between five and twenty seconds to your videos, but keep in mind that the video must be at least 25 seconds long to have an end screen. There are a number of fully customizable templates available that can be uses to promote your upcoming videos or to invite viewers to subscribe to your channel.</p><p>Wanna making YouTube thumbnail yourself?

Your end screen will not add to the length of your video, it will overlay onto the last 5-20 seconds.</p><p>Here’s how you add an End Screen:</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>YouTube Studio</strong>, then switch to <strong>Videos</strong> on the left menu;</li><li>Click <strong>Details</strong> next to the video you want to add an end screen to.</li><li>Click the <strong>End screen</strong> in the menu under the lower right window.</li><li>Click <strong>Element</strong> to start adding videos, playlists, and subscribe buttons to your outro.

You need 4,000 hours of watch time (over the past 12 months) in order to qualify for monetization&#x2F;the YouTube Partner Program, and watch time also plays an important role in how your videos are ranked in YouTube’s search results.</p><p>Watch time is more important than views. If you’re getting views, but people are only watching short sections of your video, YouTube’s algorithm thinks the people who are clicking on your videos don’t like them and ranks them lower.</p><p>Outros are one of the best ways of increasing the watch time for your channel, because the whole point of an outro is to convince viewers to stick around and watch more videos. Here are some best practices:</p><p><strong>Link to related videos and playlists</strong>: if someone has watched one video on a topic to the end, they’ll likely be interested in another highly related video from you. For example, someone who’s watched a Let’s Play for God of War is more likely to be interested in another God of War video than your review of your new gaming headset.</p><p><strong>Link to your newest video:</strong> YouTube’s algorithm places the most weight on the data it collects about your video within the first 24 hours of it being listed as Public. To give your newest video it’s the best chance at success, you should do everything you can to boost its watch time when it’s first posted and linking to it in the end screens of all your other videos is one way to do that.</p><p>You don’t have to change every screen individually, YouTube lets you link to your most recent video automatically.</p><p><strong>Link to Playlists:</strong> if you can get a viewer watching a playlist of related videos then that’s great for your watch time. If they’re already in a playlist they’re far more likely to watch multiple videos than if they have to go to your channel page and hunt down the content they’re interested in.</p><p><strong>Include a ‘CTA’ with your subscribe button:</strong> besides just including a button people can use to subscribe, you should ask them to click on it with a ‘Call to Action’ or CTA.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Exploring-the-World-of-ASPECT-RATIOS-in-YOUTUBE-Content"><a href="#Exploring-the-World-of-ASPECT-RATIOS-in-YOUTUBE-Content" class="headerlink" title="Exploring the World of ASPECT RATIOS in YOUTUBE Content"></a>Exploring the World of ASPECT RATIOS in YOUTUBE Content</h2><p>Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.</p><p>Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg"                      alt="youtube platform"                ></p><p>Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos</h2><p>YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.</p><p>Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads"></a>Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads</h2><p>If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income. Or, if you are already in some business and want to grow your business, do it with YouTube Ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-ads-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube-ads-aspect-ratio"                ></p><p>Now, you might be wondering, what would be the possible YouTube Outro size or YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for YouTube Ads?

It was launched in February 2005 and today it is serving like one of the biggest social media network. This platform was actually designed by few creative PayPal workers.</p><p><strong>Dailymotion:</strong> It is a French social site and one popular competitor against YouTube. This site was launched by Orange on 15th March, 2005. You can watch wide range of videos on Dailymotion but for limited duration of time.</p><h2 id="Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion</h2><p> Here we few key terms that can help you to understand difference between YouTube and Dailymotion:</p><h4 id="1-Numbers"><a href="#1-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="1.Numbers"></a>1.Numbers</h4><p> The total number of viewers that interact with site like Dailymotion and YouTube is actually one of the important parameter for business because it decides the number of video ads and text that will be placed on site. We all know that YouTube is world’s biggest network for videos and Dailymotion follows it at second number. Statistics reveal that there are so many advantages of YouTube over Dailymotion, especially in terms of total site visitors as YouTube gets billions of visitors per month but this count is limited to 112 million visitors in case of Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="2-3D-Videos"><a href="#2-3D-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.3D Videos"></a>2.3D Videos</h4><p> 3D videos are one of the biggest needs of viewers these days so its availability on site definitely boosts site importance in market. As YouTube is developed with Beta so it is capable enough to provide impressive 3D viewing experience to viewers but on the other side, Dailymotion lacks behind in this capability. You cannot enjoy 3D content on Dailymotion screens.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Quality"><a href="#3-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Video Quality"></a>3.Video Quality</h4><p> One more important criterion for comparison between YouTube and Dailymotion is the overall allowed time limit for video uploads. In case of Dailymotion, you will often find all videos with less than 60 minute duration but on YouTube, video can be of any big length as it never poses any restriction on the basis of time duration. Here is one wonderful thing to know that on YouTube videos of worth 72 hour duration are uploaded per second. And viewers in YouTube are capable enough to watch fresh videos day and night.</p><p> Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="4-Analytics"><a href="#4-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="4.Analytics"></a>4.Analytics</h4><p> You might be aware about the fact that YouTube is owned by Behemoth Google; that is why it possesses most robust analytics tools as like YouTube insights. With these advanced tools, businesses as well as individuals can monitor their viewers on videos. They can also make analysis about how long and how often a particular visitor stays on videos. It helps businesses to improve their video content so that more visitors can be attracted. Dailymotion cannot offer you such details, here you can access just publication date of video, nothing else. The true fact is that Dailymotion itself has a YouTube channel that users often access to upload multiple videos so that Dailymotion can avail some promotions.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos"></a>Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos</h2><p> If you often watch, download or upload videos on YouTube and Dailymotion platform then you may also need to edit them time to time.
