But if you don’t keep on top of it, your Watch Later list can quickly become unmanageable and cluttered with content that you no longer want to watch afterward.</p><p>If you are wondering how, you can declutter the playlist, we’ve got you covered. To help you with the task, we’ve compiled a comprehensive step-by-step guide. In this article, we will show you how to clear Watch Later on YouTube with just a few clicks.</p><p>So, without beating around the bush, let’s get started with our tutorial!</p><h2 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist</h2><p>If your YouTube Watch Later playlist is filled with videos you’ll never watch again, or you are not interested in that specific content type, you can quickly delete these videos at any time.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step process on <strong>how to clear Watch Later on YouTube Web and App:</strong></p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?</h3><p>You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:</p><h5 id="From-YouTube-Homepage"><a href="#From-YouTube-Homepage" class="headerlink" title="From YouTube Homepage"></a>From YouTube Homepage</h5><p>To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin"><strong>YouTube homepage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Sign into your account if needed and click the <strong>“Library”</strong> option located at the left-hand side menu panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png"                      alt="accessing the youtube web library"                ></p><p>Step2 Croll down and click the <strong>“See All”</strong> option under the Watch Later header. Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.</p><p>Step3 From the drop-down menu, click <strong>“Remove Watch Videos.”</strong> This will instantly remove all the videos you’ve watched but are still in the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/removing-watched-videos-from-youtube-watch-later.png"                      alt="removing watched videos from youtube watch later"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the <strong>Three Dots</strong>. Select the <strong>“Remove from Watch Later”</strong> option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="clearing the youtube watch later playlist"                ></p><h5 id="Using-A-Script"><a href="#Using-A-Script" class="headerlink" title="Using A Script"></a>Using A Script</h5><p>Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> browser on your system and head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website**.** Next, select the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the left pane and click <strong>“Watch Later”</strong> from the menu.</p><p>Step2 Now, hit the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + J”</strong> keys on Windows or the <strong>“Command + Option+ J”</strong> buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png"                      alt="using script to clear watch later"                ></p><p>Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.</p><p>setInterval(function () { document.querySelector(‘#primary button[aria-label&#x3D;”Action menu”]‘).click(); var things &#x3D; document.evaluate( ‘&#x2F;&#x2F;span[contains(text(),”Remove from”)]‘, document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null ); for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);</p><p>Step4 In the last step, hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some. The script above has been confirmed to work, but others still need to be thoroughly checked and could potentially damage your computer. To prevent this from happening, only look for scripts from reliable sources instead of those posted by random people in various forums.</p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?</h3><p>If you are using YouTube on an Android or iOS device, it is possible to clear the Watch Later Playlist by doing the steps below:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, <strong>swipe up</strong> on the Homescreen of your Android device or <strong>swipe right</strong> on your iOS device to launch App Drawer, and tap “<strong>YouTube”</strong> to launch the app.</p><p>Step2 Now, tap the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the bottom-right corner of the screen and tap <strong>“Watch Later.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing the watch later playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, tap the three dots (vertical ellipses) icon on the top-right side of the screen and choose the <strong>“Remove Watched Videos”</strong> option to delete them from the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-watch-later-on-youtube-app.png"                      alt="clearing watch later on youtube app"                ></p><p>Step4 If there are still unwatched videos in the playlist, select a video and tap the three dots next to it.

The YouTube clips took extensive time to upload, and the library was prevalent. The YouTube ad revenue only equated to around $2000.</p><p>Although StandUpBits had uploaded thousands of clips and received over 1 million views on their channel, their library was only able to earn around $2000 from the ad revenue sharing. It’s estimated the group had spent approximately $25,000 to finish off the clips, edit them, and upload them, which means they invested far more in the channel than they earned.</p><p>If you are thinking about a career on YouTube, reaching 1 million views might seem like an excellent target for making a successful page, and it is, but reaching 1 million views doesn’t magically guarantee financial success.</p><h2 id="How-Revenue-is-Calculated-3"><a href="#How-Revenue-is-Calculated-3" class="headerlink" title="How Revenue is Calculated"></a>How Revenue is Calculated</h2><p>In order to understand how revenue is calculated over the YouTube marketplace, a YouTube user needs to first understand what the partnership program entails. Basically, a YouTube partner has the ability to monetize their videos and serve ads on their content.</p><p>In order to join this program you need to be able to commit to uploading ad-friendly (nothing controversial) content that is completely original and high quality and which also adheres to all of the community guidelines and YouTube’s Terms of Service (YouTube actually just introduced a couple of stricter rules - click here for <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization-2018---the-new-rules-everyone-hates-331.html" >YouTube Monetization 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p>As of February 2018, to qualify for ad revenue, the YouTube channel must have:</p><p>1. You will need to have 1,000 subscribers.</p><p>2. You will need to have accumulated 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months.</p><p>The AdSense revenue that you earn through YouTube will vary depending on a large number of factors related to the specific ads running and what type of content you produce.</p><h2 id="Understanding-CPM-and-CPCs-3"><a href="#Understanding-CPM-and-CPCs-3" class="headerlink" title="Understanding CPM and CPCs"></a>Understanding CPM and CPCs</h2><h3 id="What-is-CPM-3"><a href="#What-is-CPM-3" class="headerlink" title="What is CPM?"></a>What is CPM?</h3><p>CPM stands as the ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand.’</p><p>Your CPM is the amount you earn for 1000 ad impressions (1000 viewers clicking on an ad or watching a skippable ad). Your CPM is usually related to the demographics of your users, the content you regularly post, the length of time on the videos that you post, and the gender of your viewers. YouTube CPMs can vary depending on the advertising bid the company has submitted with Google. The lowest bids can be around .33 cents per thousand views, and other advertisers can spend as much as $10 for 1000 views.</p><p>For example, gaming is the most prominent genre on YouTube, and there are many gaming-related ads to go around, but most of them are very low-paying (i.e., ads for free online games). Only YouTube gamers with extensive subscriber bases get higher-paying ads.</p><h3 id="What-is-CPC-3"><a href="#What-is-CPC-3" class="headerlink" title="What is CPC?"></a>What is CPC?</h3><p>CPC means ‘cost per click.’ A CPC ad interprets an ‘ad impression’ as a click on an ad rather than a viewer merely seeing it. Most YouTube ads are CPC ads, but skippable video ads are CPV (cost per view), and impressions are based on viewers watching the ad instead of skipping it.</p><h2 id="Changes-on-YouTube-and-How-You-Can-Earn-More-3"><a href="#Changes-on-YouTube-and-How-You-Can-Earn-More-3" class="headerlink" title="Changes on YouTube and How You Can Earn More"></a>Changes on YouTube and How You Can Earn More</h2><p>Changes that have affected the way that revenue is calculated are the ability to skip ads and the lower click rates on advertising through YouTube. A huge portion of viewers uses ad blockers, which eliminates them as potential sources of revenue.</p><p>Ultimately earning ad revenue is a big game of reaching targeted demographics and <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >achieving ongoing viewership <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your videos. It does matter where your viewers are going to be viewing from, and the audience that your viewers are in (viewers from areas with more disposable income to spend on the products advertised to them are worth more to advertisers, as are viewers who are interested in higher-cost items).</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/tips-for-youtube-brand-deals-from-marketing-pro-amanda-haines-171.html" >Forming relationships with brands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and doing product placements or sponsored videos can be a great way to earn more revenue than you will through AdSense. Just make sure the brands you build relationships with are relevant to your audience and that you incorporate the advertising in ways that don’t annoy your viewers.</p><p>Use the right keywords in your titles, descriptions, and tags. Without this keyword information, YouTube may pair your video with advertisers that aren’t right for your audience. First, using the wrong keywords won’t put your content in front of the viewers who want to see it, and, second, the ads that run won’t be a good fit and thus are less likely to be clicked on. It’s also imperative that you focus on the metadata of every video. It can take some extra time to add in all of this information for each video, but it is well worth it if you are trying to get paid from YouTube.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-boost%21-the-4-simplest-tricks-to-grow-your-317.html" >Click here for 4 ways to start growing your channel faster. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, how much does YouTube pay for 1 million views?

Channel art can be a great way to show creativity, and there are also ways you can design your banner to help your channel grow.</p><p>Here are the Dos and Don’ts of YouTube Channel Art.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#background">What Kind of Background Should I Use?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#face">Should I Use My Face?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#write">What Should I Write on Banner?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#good">How Can I Make My Channel Art Look Good?</a></strong></li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Kind-of-Background-Should-I-Use"><a href="#Part-1-What-Kind-of-Background-Should-I-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Kind of Background Should I Use?"></a>Part 1: What Kind of Background Should I Use?</h2><h4 id="DO-High-Quality-Photos"><a href="#DO-High-Quality-Photos" class="headerlink" title="DO: High-Quality Photos"></a><em>DO: High-Quality Photos</em></h4><p>It’s easy to take pictures with our phones, but not all of these pictures will look great blown up for channel art.</p><p>When choosing great photos for your background, pick ones that are high quality and don’t become pixelated once they are blown up. There are tons of free stock photo websites out there to help you find a high-quality picture that’s perfect for your channel.</p><h4 id="DON’T-Use-Chaotic-Patterns"><a href="#DON’T-Use-Chaotic-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="DON’T: Use Chaotic Patterns"></a><em>DON’T: Use Chaotic Patterns</em></h4><p>Using patterns for the background of your channel banner can help your channel look super creative and stand out from others. However, if you use a pattern that is chaotic and hard on the eyes, you may not attract many subscribers. When using patterns, choose patterns that are not heavy in color and have too many lines or shapes. There should be an evenness to the shapes and negative space within the pattern itself. Try to stay away from patterns that are 3D which can conflict with the viewer’s eyesight and make them dizzy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-banner-background.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Channel Banner Background"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Should-I-Use-My-Face"><a href="#Part-2-Should-I-Use-My-Face" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Should I Use My Face?"></a>Part 2: Should I Use My Face?</h2><p>Whether you should use your face on your channel banner depends on what your channel is about. If you have a channel focused on beauty, fashion, fitness, or family vlogs then it’s a good idea to include your face. It comes off personable and helps viewers relate to you. If you have a channel that is about something like gaming, tech reviews, or book reviews then it isn’t necessary to include your face because the focus of your content isn’t you as a personality.</p><p>If you do include pictures, here are some tips:</p><h4 id="Don’t-Use-Blurry-Photos"><a href="#Don’t-Use-Blurry-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Use Blurry Photos"></a><em>Don’t: Use Blurry Photos</em></h4><p>If your photos are blurry, pixilated, or poor quality then don’t use them. Using blurry pictures comes off as unprofessional.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you have to hire a photographer to take pictures for your channel. The average smartphone takes really great pictures, so long as you have enough light. If you need a great picture, use a high-quality selfie or ask a friend to take a nice picture of you.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Use-Outdated-Pictures"><a href="#Don’t-Use-Outdated-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Use Outdated Pictures"></a><em>Don’t: Use Outdated Pictures</em></h4><p>It is always best to use a current photo of yourself. Many times viewers will go and follow you on social media as well. If they see that you have current photos on your social media but not on your channel, they are become confused and perhaps lose interest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Should-I-Write-on-My-Banner"><a href="#Part-3-What-Should-I-Write-on-My-Banner" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Should I Write on My Banner?"></a>Part 3: What Should I Write on My Banner?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-banner-write.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Channel Banner writing"                ></p><h4 id="Do-Include-Your-Channel-Name"><a href="#Do-Include-Your-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Your Channel Name"></a><em>Do: Include Your Channel Name</em></h4><p>While including your channel name in your banner seems like a no brainer, it is often left out by aspiring YouTubers. Displaying your channel name in a large font allows it to be more visible for viewers - your channel name is already on the page, but it is underneath your channel art and doesn’t stand out.</p><p>Seeing your channel name included in your banner also helps viewers to know they are on the right page, if there are YouTubers out there with similar names to yours.</p><h4 id="Do-Include-Upload-Days"><a href="#Do-Include-Upload-Days" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Upload Days"></a><em>Do: Include Upload Days</em></h4><p>Consistent upload days are highly important for gaining more views and subscribers. Including your exact upload days helps viewers know when they should expect new videos from you. I made the mistake of not including upload days when I first started my channel 3 years ago. I had drops in views because my subscribers didn’t know when I would upload videos.</p><p>If you find that you cannot stick to a certain upload day, try to include how often you will post instead. For example, you can say, “New Videos Posted Weekly.” Viewers will respect you more and even be more likely to subscribe when you tell them your upload days. They want a guarantee that you’re going to post again in the near future.</p><h4 id="Do-Include-Social-Media"><a href="#Do-Include-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Social Media"></a><em>Do: Include Social Media</em></h4><p>Social media accounts are important to include in your channel art because we live in a social media generation. People are on social media every second of the day. If you are looking to take your YouTube channel seriously, it is good practice to ask viewers to follow you on your social media.</p><p>Including social media icons in your channel art lets people know where they can find you. Another good reason to include your current social media in your banner is that sometimes you might join a new platform or quit an old one. You may be using Twitter for months and then decide that you like Facebook better. Your current social media handles keep subscribers from having to guess which one to follow you on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-banner-safe-area.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Channel Banner Safe Area"                ></p><p><em>Make sure everything important fits in the safe area!</em></p><h4 id="Do-Include-Brief-Channel-Description-or-Tag-Line"><a href="#Do-Include-Brief-Channel-Description-or-Tag-Line" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Brief Channel Description or Tag Line"></a><em>Do: Include Brief Channel Description or Tag Line</em></h4><p>Aside from your channel name, you should also include a brief channel description or tag line to tell your viewers what your channel is all about. If you’re an aspiring beauty guru, you may include something like Makeup Tutorials, Product Reviews, or Mommy Makeovers. Or, you may include a cool tag line that describes the goal of your channel, like “Empowering Mother’s Through Makeup.”</p><p>I’ve noticed that YouTubers that use 2-3 descriptive words in their channel art make many different types of videos on their channel but they all full under those categories.</p><p>YouTubers that use tag lines are using their channel as a platform to carry out a specific mission on giving help or educating others.</p><p>Whether you decide to use descriptive words or a tag line, they will help your channel tremendously by setting expectations for your viewers.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-I-Make-My-Channel-Art-Look-Good"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-I-Make-My-Channel-Art-Look-Good" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How Can I Make My Channel Art Look Good?"></a>Part 4: How Can I Make My Channel Art Look Good?</h2><h4 id="Do-Create-Consistent-Branding"><a href="#Do-Create-Consistent-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Do: Create Consistent Branding"></a><em>Do: Create Consistent Branding</em></h4><p>Since becoming a YouTuber myself, I’ve come to learn that paying attention to your branding is very important. Focus attention to what colors and fonts you use. The colors you use for your channel can influence your audience to feel a certain way. For example, using yellow can show that you’re happy and upbeat while using blue can show you’re more calm and relaxed. Whatever color you choose, make sure it’s a true representation of who you are.</p><p>Using the right font can also be important to your channel. There are many different fonts available now. When choosing a font, choose one that goes with your channel that is easy to read. You might choose a very pretty cursive font, but if your viewers can’t read it, it can be useless.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Include-Images-That-Have-Nothing-to-Do-with-Your-Channel"><a href="#Don’t-Include-Images-That-Have-Nothing-to-Do-with-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Include Images That Have Nothing to Do with Your Channel"></a><em>Don’t: Include Images That Have Nothing to Do with Your Channel</em></h4><p>This simple mistake can cost you many subscribers. For example, if your channel is about Beauty videos, then your channel art shouldn’t include pictures of food or you eating a burger. Your channel art is the first thing that viewers see when clicking on your page. You want them to instantly know what your channel is all about without having to find it in the description box. If your channel is about a few different things, then include all of those images in the channel art so they still know what your channel about. Just don’t confuse your viewers as to what your channel is really about.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Have-Images-and-Text-That-Cut-Off"><a href="#Don’t-Have-Images-and-Text-That-Cut-Off" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Have Images and Text That Cut Off"></a><em>Don’t: Have Images and Text That Cut Off</em></h4><p>YouTube helps YouTubers by giving them a free channel art template to use as a guide when creating channel art. The template includes 3 different perspectives on how your channel art will be viewed by people looking at mobile devices, computer screens, and TVs. Many people make the mistake of creating art on the TV perspective which then cuts off images and text for the mobile and computer views. To save you the trouble of having images that cut off, it’s best to create your channel in the mobile dimensions that way it will be seen in the computer and TV dimensions with no problem.</p><p><em>Joshelle is a YouTuber from Atlanta, GA.

All you need to do to access it is, sign in to your Google account, tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the bottom, and tap <strong>Create a Short</strong> in the popup box that comes up.</p><ol><li><strong>What if YouTube Shorts is not showing on my YouTube app?</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that your YouTube app is updated to its latest version. If the app is already updated, and <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still unavailable, the chances are that Google hasn’t rolled the app in your region. Since <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still in its Beta phase, only the region of India can use all the functions of the app at the time of this writing. In such a case, you are suggested to wait until the <strong>YouTube Shorts app</strong> is made available for your location.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts video duration?</strong></li></ol><p>A <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> video can be of only up to 60 seconds.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts size limitation?</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube hasn’t provided any information related to this as of now. However, you can rest assure that a 60 seconds long video file wouldn’t be too large for YouTube to handle.</p><ol><li><strong>How many subs do you need to access Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is available for everyone regardless of the number of subscribers the channel has.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you make money on Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, NO. Although you cannot monetize the recordings published as <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong>, they can be a good source to drive subscribers to your main YouTube channel that may have the videos that can be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-storytelling-potential-making-youtube-trailers-in-filmora/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing Storytelling Potential  Making YouTube Trailers in Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-evaluating-mr-beasts-monetary-world-for-2024/"><u>[New] Evaluating Mr. Beast's Monetary World for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cutting-edge-techniques-for-ios-users-uploading-videos-to-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Techniques for iOS Users Uploading Videos to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-building-a-brand-through-youtube-a-strategic-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, Building a Brand Through YouTube  A Strategic Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-affordable-online-education-hosting-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Affordable Online Education  Hosting on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-swiftness-at-a-click-managing-youtubes-video-speed-settings/"><u>[Updated] Swiftness at a Click  Managing YouTube's Video Speed Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cinematic-dialogue-assembler/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Cinematic Dialogue Assembler</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-tutorial-on-editing-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Tutorial on Editing YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-music-files-from-vivo-g2-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>How To  Restore Missing Music Files from Vivo G2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-realme-narzo-60x-5g-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>How to unlock Realme Narzo 60x 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/explore-the-world-of-mobile-video-editing-with-snapchat-favorites/"><u>Explore the World of Mobile Video Editing with Snapchat Favorites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/pro-level-action-cams-for-clear-unwavering-videos/"><u>Pro-Level Action Cams for Clear, Unwavering Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-mechanics-of-modern-photography-auto-smart-hdr-3-and-4-unveiled/"><u>[New] The Mechanics of Modern Photography  Auto, Smart HDR 3 & 4 Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-tips-for-evaluating-the-best-sound-editing-talent-of-our-time/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Essential Tips for Evaluating the Best Sound Editing Talent of Our Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-amplify-your-storytelling-integrating-captions-in-a-triple-threat-on-ig/"><u>[New] In 2024, Amplify Your Storytelling - Integrating Captions in a Triple Threat on IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-integrating-advanced-movie-capture-on-diverse-tech-environments/"><u>In 2024, Integrating Advanced Movie Capture on Diverse Tech Environments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-triple-tactic-tracker-how-to-scrutinize-your-subscriber-earnings-on-googles-platform-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Triple Tactic Tracker  How to Scrutinize Your Subscriber Earnings on Google's Platform, YouTube</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

These images or called “frames”. Frame rate is expressed in “frames per second or FPS”. The unit or term is applicable for film, cameras, motion capture, video, and computer graphics. This is also known as “frame frequency”, expressed in the unit “hertz”</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong></p><p> Resolution is a measure to entail the clarity and sharpness of an image and most often used as a metric to judge the quality of cameras, monitors, printers, etc.</p><p> It basically refers to the number of different pixels in each dimension which can be viewed in any display device.</p><p><strong>File Size</strong></p><p> File size refers to the space that a file occupies in a storage medium, like hard drive or USB.

To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.</p><h2 id="The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos"></a>The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png" >Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source_channel=seo_article&spm=rs.filmora_web" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&amp;spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="1-Panzoid"><a href="#1-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="1.

Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Blender"><a href="#2-Blender" class="headerlink" title="2. Blender"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, Windows, macOS</p><p>Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.</p><h4 id="3-Renderforest"><a href="#3-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="3. Renderforest"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.renderforest.com/" >Renderforest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.</p><h4 id="4-MotionDen"><a href="#4-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="4. MotionDen"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://motionden.com/" >MotionDen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,00</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.</p><h4 id="5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube"><a href="#5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Setting-Up-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-1-Setting-Up-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Setting Up Your YouTube Channel"></a>Part 1: Setting Up Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>Before you start making awesome videos, you got to set up your YouTube account. Activating YouTube is pretty straightforward if you already have a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Sign in to YouTube with your Google account</p><p>Step 2: Access YouTube Creator Studio to Activate YouTube</p><p>Step 3: Create a Channel</p><h3 id="1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name"><a href="#1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Picking a YouTube Channel Name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>A YouTube channel name is beneficial to your channel’s growth if selected strategically. It can separate you from all the other channels on the platform, it can help the viewers understand what your channel is all about, and it will represent you and your brand. When naming your channel, here are 3 things to remember:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorable</strong>: You’d want a name that sticks in people’s brains. Picking a name that is hard to forget will be a huge advantage for you while growing your channel. But what makes a name memorable?</li><li><strong>Alliteration and assonance</strong>: By using the repetition of consonant or vowel sounds, you create a fluidity to the name. examples: Pewdiepie, GoPro, or League of Legend.</li><li><strong>Fun to say</strong>: Some words stay in the brain because it is simply pleasurable to say. It could have a genuine meaning or it can be an abstract word. Commonly these names have one of these sharp, biting consonants: C, K, Q, X, or Z. examples: Markiplier, Kwebbelkop, Squeezie, and Vox.</li><li><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: A name can have a greater meaning, but long names might not be catchy, therefore, you should abbreviate it to a few memorable letters. Examples: TED ED, TGFbro, ERB, and FBE.</li><li><strong>Longer Phrases</strong>: You may think that having a long name may be hard to remember, but sometimes, depending on your channel, a snappy phrase works. Example: How It Should Have Ended, You Always Win, and People Are Awesome.</li><li><strong>Your Name Plus Descriptor</strong>: Combining two words effectively can make a name more memorable like Markiplier (Mark + Multiplier), LaurDIY (Lauren and she makes DIY projects), and Shameless Maya (Maya and she’s shameless).</li><li><strong>Unique</strong>: Be creative with your name, especially if your real name is generic. YouTube is a crowded space and if you simply call your channel: Jake, not only will you be competing with all the creators named Jake, but also all the content with Jake as the keywords.</li></ul><p>Also, avoid generic names that are based around your channel topics. For example, Fashion Talk sounds like a good name, but if you do a quick search you will see that it is a crowded space with vloggers, keynote presentations, and product reviews.</p><p>If you are starting a fashion channel why not try to find a link between your name and the topic? The connection between two different things often spawns something creative: Fabric Feud, for example. Just by the name, I know this channel will contain interesting perspectives on garments.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: In the end, simplicity is the way to go. Don’t make it hard to type or hard to remember:   <em>cantunderstandthistopic88768</em>  is not a good name, even if it’s strange and cryptic.</li></ul><p>If you have a simple name in mind, it’s also a good idea to do a quick search on YouTube and Google to make sure it isn’t already used or similar to another account. Additionally, it’s worth knowing whether the social media handle is available as you will need it to expand your channel.</p><p>Consider using your real full name, it’s unlikely to ever change. Many YouTubers start out with a stage name but end up growing out of it and simply using their real name later on in their journey.</p><p>We’ve summarized some creative ways of picking up a YouTube name, you can check our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picking YouTube Channel Name [4 Aspects]  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description"><a href="#2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description"></a>2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description</h3><p>YouTube is a search engine and the channel description can be treated much like an About page for a website. That is why keywords are important when composing the channel description.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What are YouTube SEO keywords? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Keywords are the words and phrases people use when they are typing into the search engine to find content. Without the right keywords, your audience may never find your videos.</p><p>If you want to start discovering new keywords for your YouTube channel, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This tool shows you the search volume (how frequently it is searched for) as well as how competitive (how many other channels are using it) the keyword is.</p><p>Heighten your chance of discoverability by putting keywords as close to the beginning of the description as possible. Later on in this post, we will go through how to properly conduct a keyword strategy. Hang tight.</p><p>In addition to keywords, you should also introduce who you are and what the channel is about. Give them a reason to care about your channel, how is it different than all the other ones on YouTube? Why are you the best person to be producing the content on your channel?</p><p>Then encourage the viewers to subscribe if they are interested in what the channel offers: education, entertainment, adventure, or something they can’t get anywhere else. It’s your channel, sell it.</p><p>Finally supply some extra details, including when to expect videos to be published and other social platforms where you are active on. If someone is reading your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube description <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you have already hooked them.

What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?"></a>#1. What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?</h4><p>You may choose an icon that best represents the content your channel is producing. For example, if your channel is about technology, you can have an icon of a robot or an iPhone. This way, when viewers only see your icon, they have an idea that they can expect content around tech.</p><p>Here are some websites in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download logos and icons for YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be"><a href="#2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be" class="headerlink" title="#2. What Color Should Your YouTube Logo Be?"></a>#2. What Color Should Your YouTube Logo Be?</h4><p>When creating your logo, avoid trendy colors as they may go out of style. Instead, consider <a class="link"   href="https://99designs.ca/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/" >the psychology of color <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What emotions do you want your channel to evoke to your viewers?</p><p>Answering this question helps you develop a consistent branding that applies to all your content as your channel grows. Blue evokes calm and trust, whereas, red is known to increase heart rate and is associated with danger. Before you select a color scheme, know how you want your audience to feel.</p><h4 id="3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have"><a href="#3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have" class="headerlink" title="#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?"></a>#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?</h4><p>While YouTube doesn’t offer a lot of real-estate for text, you might still want to include the name of your brand on your logo.</p><p>Potentially, the font you choose for your logo will also be the font for the text that appears on your YouTube videos and your channel art. With that in mind, it is important that you pick one that works best for you at the start. Here are some details to look for when selecting a font.</p><p><strong>Legibility</strong>: Does the font get too hard to read the smaller it gets? It’s not uncommon for some fonts to become a messy blur once the size is reduced on desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The most important thing about the font is its readability. If it looks like your doctor’s handwriting, then it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Placed next to your icon, does the font look natural? You might not want to put an icon of a robot next to a font that looks like calligraphy.</p><h4 id="4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo"><a href="#4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo" class="headerlink" title="#4. How Should You Design Your YouTube Logo?"></a>#4. How Should You Design Your YouTube Logo?</h4><p>Do you really need borders or supporting texts? I ask because the more you have on your logo, the less space it will have to stand out.</p><p>White space is your friend, it keeps the viewer’s attention focused on what matters and keeps the design uncluttered.</p><p>Save your logo as a vector so that you have the ability to scale without losing the image’s quality.</p><p>I get it, you are here to make a YouTube channel, not to design a logo. You’re not a designer.

Doing so allows people to see who you are and develop an instant connection with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Makes-A-Good-YouTube-Channel-Banner"><a href="#5-What-Makes-A-Good-YouTube-Channel-Banner" class="headerlink" title="#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?"></a>#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?</h4><p>Your YouTube banner, or sometimes known as the channel art, is the cover page for your YouTube channel.</p><p>While the old adage tells us not to judge anything by the cover, in a world where we have a surplus of content, it is something we all must do for the sake of our time. If we see channel art that doesn’t appeal to us or doesn’t match the video content created, it is jarring. We are distracted from what matters and left questioning why we are on this channel in the first place.</p><p>Alternatively, if YouTube channel art is well designed and matches the aesthetic of the channel, then it can inspire your viewers to watch more, share, and subscribe.</p><p>So with that said, what makes a great YouTube banner?</p><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: YouTube comes with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >sizing recommendations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The size they suggest is because of all the different devices viewers use to consume content.</p><p>You cannot control where and how your viewers consume your content. They can be watching on desktop, smartphone, tablet, or tv via Apple TV or Chromecast. That is why it is so important to have a responsive design: appropriate sizing and layout ensures that nothing important is cut off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-simone-giertz.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Banners"                ></p><p><strong>Less is more</strong>: There is already a lot happening on your YouTube channel page. Crowding your channel art will add more chaos than clarity. Additionally, since the design will shift from device to device, you may lose elements of the design if it is overcrowded.</p><p><strong>Keep it in the middle</strong>: By keeping all the design elements and text within the safe zone, you can assure nothing will be cut out even if it is viewed on a less than optimal screen. It is a shame when you see that a headline is cut out and you cannot read the whole banner. Use YouTube’s template to help guide your design and ensure that everything important is visible.</p><p><strong>High-resolution images</strong>: Nothing shouts “I’m an amateur” like having a pixelated image for your banner. Setting a high standard for images at the start will ensure that your whole channel will look professional from the beginning.</p><p>Take a go at creating your own channel art with some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >great YouTube design tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Canva and Crello.</p><p>Don’t have time to design at the moment? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download 50 free YouTube banner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we created to help busy creators like yourself get a professional page up and running right away.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan"><a href="#Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan"></a>Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan</h2><p>Now that you know how to create a YouTube channel, you will need content to fill it up.</p><p>There are many factors to having success on YouTube and one has always been delivering content consistently. You may feel at this moment, that your brain is storming with ideas, but believe me, you don’t want to get caught in a drought. The way to avoid major blockers for your channel is to have a <a class="link"   href="https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-content-planning" >content plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the onset.</p><p>A content plan helps guide you towards the mission, the reason you are building this YouTube channel in the first place.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong>: Your YouTube channel will be focused on one broad topic, whether it be fashion, health, food, etc. It is hard to fly on a whim with a topic that covers such a wide scope. Creating content for these topics will require preparations and that’s why the earlier you have the content ideas for your video the more time you’ll have to research, rehearse, and get the best result.</p><p>Begin with a blank piece of paper and break down your topic into 5-10 different categories. If you have a channel about cooking, it may look something like this: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack, etc.</p><p>From there, you can drill down more and explore specific topics such as “cheap meals,” “street food,” , etc. Niching down allows those who are looking for a more specific piece of content to find your material. Also, when one specific piece of content performs well, it will give a boost to all the other content related to that broader topic.</p><p><strong>Researching Your Ideas</strong>: Now that you have a big list of ideas, it’s time to do some research. With so many idea options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the work ahead, but stay focused and tackle one idea at a time.</p><p>When it comes to videos, discoverability is an important aspect of everything you create. You aren’t only competing with other YouTube channels, you are competing with everything in the world that can turn your viewer away from your channel. That is why you should make it as easy as possible for your content to be discovered.</p><p>Pro Tip: Search on YouTube and see if there is already a video for the idea you have. By taking a quick look at what content is out there, you can see who you’ll be competing with and determine if it is worth pursuing. If there are already a lot of existing videos on that topic, it might be too hard to for people find your content at first.</p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong>: For each of your ideas, you will want to conduct extensive keyword research. This research will help dictate the tags, titles, and descriptions of your videos once they are ready to publish.</p><p>There are a few ways to conduct keyword research, but we suggest using free online tools to help cut down the time spent.</p><h3 id="1-Free-tools"><a href="#1-Free-tools" class="headerlink" title="1.

Without a proper routine and schedule, YouTubers will end up procrastinating and publishing whenever they finish their content.</p><p>In order to properly establish an audience for your channel, there needs to be consistency and that is why it is so important to have a content calendar to affirm when a piece of content is due to be published, thus giving the creator a good idea of when to start each step of the process to meet publishing date.</p><p>There are many ways to build out a content calendar, you can simply use a spreadsheet, a calendar, or you can use other management&#x2F;organization tools such as <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or <a class="link"   href="https://asana.com/" >Asana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We recommend using Google Sheet and Google Calendar to start, as it is free and easy to use.</p><p>Since you are starting out, we suggest that you plan on a monthly basis, as it’ll allow you to be flexible to trending topics and adjust to insights that you’ll acquire as you analyze your content’s performance.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Producing-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Producing-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Producing Your Content"></a>Part 3: Producing Your Content</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/produce-youtube-video-content-filming.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Filming"                ></p><p>Now that you have a plan it is time to start producing your content. There are many ways to approach this, as different types of channels will have different processes for researching, capturing footage, and editing.</p><p><strong>Planning</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a fully flushed script, but any bit of planning before hitting the record button will help you prepare some valuable content to be captured. It can be an outline, breaking down the topics you want to touch on.</p><p>If it’s a food YouTube channel, you’d want the recipe and all the ingredients ready on hand. <em>Mise en place</em> is the French phrase that chefs use meaning “everything in its place” or having everything they need on hand so when dinner rush comes preparation is done and now they are ready to produce. This same mentality works when preparing to shoot a YouTube video. The more you prepare the easier the shoot and the editing will be.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>: At the start, you can get everything done on your smartphone. But that does depend on what your channel is going to be about and who your target audiences are. If you want to film some simple sketches to entertain people, yes, a smartphone camera can work for start. But if you are reaching a professional crowd or want to appear credible, then it might be worth it to invest in a better camera, audio, and lighting equipment.</p><p><strong>Filming&#x2F;Capturing</strong>: Always do some checks before shooting your YouTube videos as bad camera angles, poor audio quality, inadequate lighting are all easier to fix before rather than after the filming. Additionally, set a reminder to backup your footage and charge your batteries after every shoot and have an extension cord or a separate hard drive ready.</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Over time, you will develop your own editing style. At the start, it is best to learn the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong>: Some video editing software programs are free and others cost a lot. Do your research, sign up for free trials, and understand the limitations of the applications and the requirements you need. If money is a factor, you might want to stick with the free options such as iMovie or affordable options such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Skilled editing enables YouTube creators to tell the story in the most effective way. This does not mean in chronological order. Think of what will hook the audience right away and what will be most impactful at the very end. Pro-tip: Use pre-set transitions sparingly, jump cuts are often the most effective and least distracting. Editing is an invisible art.</p><p><strong>Text, graphic or special effects</strong>: Video is a show that doesn’t tell medium, so use text sparingly. People aren’t going to your channel to read. However, text when used properly compliments the video and supplies context. Graphics and special effects are good when they support the story you are telling and cheesy when used egregiously to impress the viewer.</p><p><strong>Export to the right format</strong>: You can pretty much upload any video format to YouTube and they can figure it out.

Strive to build click-worthy titles that inspire curiosity, evoke an emotion, or offer a benefit.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Good: How to Deep Fry Chicken</p><p>Better: Deep Frying Chicken That’s Better Than KFC</p><p>While you have 100 characters to work with, anything beyond 70 characters will be truncated by YouTube.</p><p>Caution: Always deliver what your title is selling.

Tips for Designing the Best Thumbnail Image"></a>4. Tips for Designing the Best Thumbnail Image</h4><p><strong>Customize thumbnails</strong>: It is recommended that you take some time to customize a thumbnail image for your video. This is the first impression and you want to entice the viewer to click and watch.</p><p>YouTube auto-selects your thumbnail from a random position on your timeline, so it isn’t mandatory to create a thumbnail, however, the image YouTube selects might not be what you want to use to attract your audience.</p><p><strong>Use photo editing software</strong>: To control how you want an image to look, you will need to choose a photo editing software. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good choice that provides various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg"                      alt="pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker"                ></p><p><strong>Have a consistent look</strong>: By having consistency, people will begin to recognize your thumbnails and even getting them excited to watch your video.</p><p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong></p><p>- Avoid using YouTube’s randomly selected thumbnail. Personalize it to stay consistent with your brand.</p><p>- Don’t clutter thumbnails. Less is more.</p><p>- Make fonts big if you are going to use text.</p><p>- Thumbnails have to have context, what is their story? Deliver on that promise.</p><p>- Using emotive faces have shown to appeal to people’s emotional cues and increases the likelihood of them clicking.</p><p>- Thumbnail file size should be 1280 x 720</p><h4 id="5-Closed-Captions-and-Uploading-a-Transcript"><a href="#5-Closed-Captions-and-Uploading-a-Transcript" class="headerlink" title="5. Closed Captions and Uploading a Transcript"></a>5. Closed Captions and Uploading a Transcript</h4><p>There are two key reasons why it is worth your time to use closed captions or upload a transcript for your YouTube videos.</p><ol><li>Having closed captions improves the video’s SEO, as Google indexes and crawls the keywords.</li><li>For those that don’t want to or can’t hear the audio will appreciate having closed caption to allow them to enjoy the content.</li></ol><h4 id="6-How-to-Share-Your-Video-with-Social-Media"><a href="#6-How-to-Share-Your-Video-with-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="6. How to Share Your Video with Social Media"></a>6. How to Share Your Video with Social Media</h4><p>Unless you have a huge social media following, it will be challenging to get many views from those channels at the start.</p><p>Grow your social media channel gradually by targeting your ideal viewer persona and hashtagging your content. On social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter, keep producing content for them, but don’t forget to share content from other YouTubers. If you see a cool video relevant to your audience, share it as well.</p><p>Lead your followers to your YouTube channel with content designed specifically for your social media channel. For example, Instagram Stories are a great way to engage directly with your followers, giving them a sneak peek or letting them know that your latest YouTube videos are up. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.plannthat.com/instagram-story-links/" >link directly to your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>from your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-caspar-lee.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Story Caspar Lee"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Caspar Lee</em></p><p>Join groups on social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, etc. and engage in conversations that are related or complementary to your YouTube channel. The key is to find communities that are interested in the content you are producing, but approach those groups with caution and ensure that anything you share won’t be perceived as spam.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There you go, now you have made your first YouTube video. It might be something you are incredibly proud of or it might have been a great learning experience. It might have gone without a hitch or you might have encountered obstacles you weren’t anticipating. Either way, you followed through and we are happy for you.</p><p>Now, get ready for the next one. The job of a YouTuber is never complete as there is always another video to make. By executing what we taught you in this guide, you now have the foundation to grow your channel.

You had to accumulate over 1,000 subscribers and over 4,000 public watch hours. This can be difficult to attain, especially on a platform where creators are publishing new content every day. However, the 2023 update on the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) provided an easier way to start making money on YouTube.

Split Screen Video Editor"></a>2. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split Screen Video Editor</strong></a></h3><p>YouTube Shorts are limited to a length of 1 minute only. Since 60 seconds is quite a short time, you may want to showcase your content on multiple screens. The Split Screen Video Editor on Filmora allows you to make a split screen instantly. Choose from the readily available templates and show your audience what you want from multiple perspectives in the same video.</p><h3 id="3-Motion-Tracking"><a href="#3-Motion-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="3.

Adding objects to your videos makes them fun and engaging. The motion tracking feature on Filmora allows you to track the movement of an object in the video. You can then pin graphics on the object, making the video more exciting. You can also add specific text and align it to an object, allowing your audience to follow through the story.</p><h3 id="4-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#4-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="4. Speed Ramping"></a>4. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Speed Ramping</strong></a></h3><p>The way you present your video means a lot to the audience. No one wants a boring or a really slow-moving video. With the Speed Ramping feature on Filmora, you can adjust the speed of your Shorts with better control of your keyframes. This allows you to create unique cinematic effects that keep the audience wanting more of the content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The introduction of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ policy update was a special moment for small YouTubers. It meant that the platform was extending its YPP program to more creators, allowing them to earn money from their content. Lowering the monetization requirement gives more people a chance to make money faster. However, it is important to make sure that your videos are offering value to your audience. We recommend using Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos and make sure they stand out from the competition. The better your videos will be, the more views you will get, and the more money you will make.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-symphony-of-selection-assembling-your-best-music-choices-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Symphony of Selection  Assembling Your Best Music Choices on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expertly-lit-the-17-must-haves-for-youtubers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Expertly Lit  The 17 Must-Haves for Youtubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-avoiding-youtubes-controversial-scrutiny/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Avoiding YouTube's Controversial Scrutiny</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-news-narratives-concluding-flourishes/"><u>[Updated] News Narratives' Concluding Flourishes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-instant-video-hoarders-guide-to-easy-acquisition/"><u>[Updated] Instant Video Hoarder's Guide to Easy Acquisition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-experts-choice-top-8-proven-video-marketing-actions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expert's Choice  Top 8 Proven Video Marketing Actions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-revitalizing-urban-areas-with-environmental-vision-and-purpose/"><u>[Updated] Revitalizing Urban Areas with Environmental Vision and Purpose</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-snap-guide-to-building-brand-presence-and-reputation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Snap Guide to Building Brand Presence & Reputation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-can-we-bypass-motorola-edge-40-pro-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Can We Bypass Motorola Edge 40 Pro FRP?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-oppo-a78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Oppo A78 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quicktime-video-acceleration-boost-your-productivity/"><u>2024 Approved QuickTime Video Acceleration Boost Your Productivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/best-spaces-on-discord-to-date-and-meet-love/"><u>Best Spaces on Discord to Date and Meet Love</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-pictures-from-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Pictures from Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/10plus-video-editing-solutions-to-replace-windows-movie-maker/"><u>10+ Video Editing Solutions to Replace Windows Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-network-growth-share-igtv-videos-and-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Network Growth  Share IGTV Videos & FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-how-to-get-twitter-video-dimensions-in-2024/"><u>New How to Get Twitter Video Dimensions, In 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
