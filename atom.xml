So you have to pay attention to even the smallest detail, such as YouTube thumbnails to increase viewership and top YouTube SEO.</p><p>In fact, YouTube recommends this technique to get more viewers. Also, resizing your YouTube thumbnail will prevent you from getting the “file larger than 2MB error” which can cause your thumbnail to be discarded.</p><p>So, how can you use this technique?

Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software</h3><p>In addition to using dedicated video editing software, several third-party image editing programs can be used to resize images for use as YouTube thumbnails. Programs like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.</p><p>This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method.

However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP.

Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software"></a>Method 4. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software</h3><p>In addition to using dedicated video editing software, several third-party image editing programs can be used to resize images for use as YouTube thumbnails. Programs like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.</p><p>This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method.

However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP.

Live Performance"></a>1. Live Performance</h4><p>Raw talent that is unedited and uncut can make a huge impact on your audience. In the above video, William Singe and Alex Aiono perform a live mashup from beginning to end without stopping. This kind of all-in-one-take performance is even more impressive when it is flawless. If you’ve got what it takes to perform your music from beginning to end without stopping, try recording yourself doing a live performance.</p><h4 id="2-Cover-A-Classic-Song"><a href="#2-Cover-A-Classic-Song" class="headerlink" title="2. Cover A Classic Song"></a>2. Cover A Classic Song</h4><p>Although you might gain a lot of views in the short-run by covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts, you may find that your views will drop significantly in a few years when the song loses its relevance in pop culture. On the other hand, classic songs are timeless and performing them may even pleasantly evoke nostalgia to many listeners. In the video above, Daniela Andrade and HanByul Kang beautifully cover the 1934 jazz classic “Stars Fell on Alabama.” Do you have any favorite old classics?</p><h4 id="3-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-Your-Own-Lyrics"><a href="#3-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-Your-Own-Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics"></a>3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics</h4><p>As mentioned above, covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts can bring in a lot of views. But since many people do just straight covers of songs, you’ll find yourself competing for views against many other musicians if you do the same. Creatively rewriting the lyrics of the song you choose to cover is one way you can set your cover apart from all the others out there. In the above video, the performer creatively sings a cover of MAGIC!’s “Rude” from the perspective of the father in the song.</p><h4 id="4-Cover-a-Popular-Song-In-a-Different-Genre"><a href="#4-Cover-a-Popular-Song-In-a-Different-Genre" class="headerlink" title="4. Cover a Popular Song In a Different Genre"></a>4. Cover a Popular Song In a Different Genre</h4><p>Another way to set your cover apart from all the other many covers out there is to change up the genre. Whether or not everyone likes the genre you choose, it’s still undoubtedly interesting to hear a familiar song in such a different way. Postmodern Jukebox transforms a lot of current songs into old genres of music. Check out their jazzy version of Meghan Trainor’s “All About That Bass.”</p><h4 id="5-Show-Your-Musical-Adaptability-Through-Many-Genres"><a href="#5-Show-Your-Musical-Adaptability-Through-Many-Genres" class="headerlink" title="5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres"></a>5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres</h4><p>Professional musicians mostly adhere to fewer genres of music so that they don’t leave their listeners confused about who they are as a musician. This, at times, can get quite predictable and boring. Switching between multiple genres can be refreshingly interesting, especially if it’s many genres in one video. Rapper Mac Lethal explores 27 styles of rap in the above video.</p><h4 id="6-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-a-Musical-Instrument-Or-With-Several-If-You-Know-How-To-Play-More-Than-One"><a href="#6-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-a-Musical-Instrument-Or-With-Several-If-You-Know-How-To-Play-More-Than-One" class="headerlink" title="6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)"></a>6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)</h4><p>If you cover a popular song with a musical instrument, you not only have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your song, but you also have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your instrument. In the above video, Lily Liu performs “See You Again” on her Zither&#x2F;Guzheng.</p><h4 id="7-Play-Your-Musical-Instrument-In-a-Unique-Way"><a href="#7-Play-Your-Musical-Instrument-In-a-Unique-Way" class="headerlink" title="7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way"></a>7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way</h4><p>In much of the same way that performing a familiar song in a different genre can be refreshingly interesting, playing a familiar musical instrument in a different way can have the same effect. The above video is a YouTube classic video featuring Greg Pattillo playing his flute while simultaneously beatboxing.</p><h4 id="8-Cover-a-Popular-Song-Using-Odd-Non-Musical-Objects"><a href="#8-Cover-a-Popular-Song-Using-Odd-Non-Musical-Objects" class="headerlink" title="8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects"></a>8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects</h4><p>Since music is a combination of notes, you can practically create music out of anything that has a pitch, which is everything that makes a sound. With the power of editing and pitch manipulation, you can create fascinating instrumental covers like Andrew Huang’s 99 Red Balloons.</p><h4 id="9-Transform-Non-Melodic-Speech-Into-Music"><a href="#9-Transform-Non-Melodic-Speech-Into-Music" class="headerlink" title="9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music"></a>9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music</h4><p>There’s a lot you can do with music creation when you have access to software pitch manipulation. One of those things you can do is transform non-melodic speech into music. In the above video, many different clips of Donald Trump have been edited together to recreate Camila Cabello’s hit song “Havana.”</p><h4 id="10-Produce-a-Remix"><a href="#10-Produce-a-Remix" class="headerlink" title="10. Produce a Remix"></a>10. Produce a Remix</h4><p>Most of the ideas we mention in this list have to do with taking something already existing and transforming it into something new. Similarly, a remix is a transformative musical piece. But rather than performing your music in a different and interesting way, remixing involves producing digital music using music production software. In the above video, C2C remixes Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition.”</p><h4 id="11-Produce-a-Mashup"><a href="#11-Produce-a-Mashup" class="headerlink" title="11. Produce a Mashup"></a>11. Produce a Mashup</h4><p>Unlike a medley where you perform one song and then move onto the next in a sequential manner, in a mashup you blend parts and fragments of songs together in a non-sequential manner, oftentimes overlapping parts that belong to different songs (vocals from one song over the instrumental of another song). In order to do this in a way that ends up not sounding like a jumbled mess, you need to make sure all the parts you’re mixing together are not only in the same tempo, but also in the same key. My mashups have been shared all over the world.</p><h4 id="12-Make-An-Acapella-Arrangement"><a href="#12-Make-An-Acapella-Arrangement" class="headerlink" title="12. Make An Acapella Arrangement"></a>12. Make An Acapella Arrangement</h4><p>Most songs on the radio have all kinds of different sounds going on that it can be difficult to just appreciate and enjoy the sound of the human voice. Acapella arrangements, on the other hand, attempt to recreate music with just the voice. Your own voice is a musical instrument that you can use in so many different ways to make all kinds of unique sounds. Mike Tompkins is someone who has made his mark on YouTube as an acapella musician.</p><h4 id="13-Impersonate-Celebrities"><a href="#13-Impersonate-Celebrities" class="headerlink" title="13. Impersonate Celebrities"></a>13. Impersonate Celebrities</h4><p>If you’re a musician who also happens to be good at doing impersonations of celebrities, recording yourself performing a song in different voices that others are familiar with can be a huge hit. In the above video, Yanina Chiesa performs a medley of songs featuring 15 different celebrity singers.</p><h4 id="14-Music-Tutorial"><a href="#14-Music-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="14. Music Tutorial"></a>14. Music Tutorial</h4><p>YouTube is the go-to place for many people who want to learn how to do something, including music. In the above video, Anna-Maria Hefele explains how polyphonic overtone singing works.</p><h4 id="15-Make-A-Song-So-Bad-It-Just-Might-Go-Viral"><a href="#15-Make-A-Song-So-Bad-It-Just-Might-Go-Viral" class="headerlink" title="15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral"></a>15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral</h4><p>Making music that’s so bad that it goes viral is not as easy as you might think. When it comes to bad quality material, there’s probably more of those on YouTube than there is good quality material. Your music will have to be extra bad in order to stand out among the competition. Rebecca Black’s “Friday” is a notable example of this last YouTube video idea.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Keywordtool.io"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keywordtool.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful YouTube keyword tools out there, ranking hundreds of keywords by popularity. It captures data from YouTube autocomplete and allows you to create lists of keywords from that data. As well as autocompete data, you can also search for questions people are asking, which makes it highly beneficial as a YouTube SEO tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>The downside to this particular tool is that it’s fairly limited on the free version. Upgrading to Pro Basic will give you almost double the keyword results and will let you compare the volume of searches made for those terms too. However, this will set you back around $68 a year, so it’s going to be something of an investment if you go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io-result.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool "                ></p><h4 id="3-SEOChat"><a href="#3-SEOChat" class="headerlink" title="3. SEOChat"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://seochat.io/tools/keyword-suggest-tool" >SEOChat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>SEO Chat is an amazing free tool that can generate keyword ideas from Google, Amazon, Bing and YouTube. You can search for keywords from all of those sources or can just search YouTube alone to find your keyword lists. You’ll need a ‘seed’ keyword, such as ‘shoes’, ‘make up’ or ‘marketing’, and then organizes results alphabetically with other letters following your seed keyword.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seochat-youtube.jpg"                      alt="SEOChat youtube keyword tool SEOChat"                ></p><p>Simply scrolling through the results is going to give you loads of ideas for keywords and possibly content too. The tool also allows you to further expand your results by selecting a keyword and running ‘part two’ of the process, which expands those phrases even further. Your chosen keywords can be exported from the software, ready for use in your YouTube SEO tool.</p><h4 id="4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor"><a href="#4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor" class="headerlink" title="4. Gather keywords from your competitor"></a>4. Gather keywords from your competitor</h4><p>Why not learn from the best and see what’s already working for your competitors? Finding their high traffic keywords is easy and can save a lot of time and energy. To do this, pick a channel that is around your size, as they’re your nearest competitors. Steer clear of the huge channels, as you’ll find it hard to rank next to them.</p><p>Click the videos tab to see their content, and sort them by ‘most popular’ to see the ones which got the most views. Take a look at the <strong>title</strong> and the <strong>description</strong> of those videos, and you’ll find a good fistful of proven keywords that you can start using yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/most-popular-video-youtube-channel.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>That’s not all though. To maximize your competitor research, let’s dig a little deeper into the <strong>tags</strong> they have used for their videos too. Unfortunately, these are hidden on YouTube, but are easily seen using the page’s HTML. Simply right click on the page and select ‘view source’. Don’t be alarmed at the great stream of HTML that pops up, it’s easy to search using your search function (press ctrl + f on Windows or ⌘ + f on iOS) by typing in ‘keywords’ to the search box. The following terms are the tags used in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-keywords-youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>If ploughing through HTML sounds somewhat taxing, there is a handy YouTube SEO tool you can use to display the tags on page. It’s called <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy-for-youtube/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is a Chrome extension which you’ll find in the Chrome store for free.</p><h4 id="5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator"><a href="#5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator" class="headerlink" title="5. Keyword Tool Dominator"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/youtube-keyword-tool" >Keyword Tool Dominator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It’s got a grand name, but it’s actually really easy to use and a great place to start if you’re new to YouTube keyword research. Pop in your seed keywords and the Dominator will produce a list of relevant keywords related to those terms. You can then select the most useful and download them to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Keyword-tool-dominator.jpg"                      alt="tool for youtube keyword"                ></p><p>The drawback with this is that you can only perform three searches a day on the free version. Perhaps that’s enough for you to begin with, but if you want to upgrade to the unlimited version, which will also give you search volumes, it’s a one-off fee of $39.99.</p><h4 id="6-Ubersuggest"><a href="#6-Ubersuggest" class="headerlink" title="6. Ubersuggest"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For getting more data on specific keywords, Ubersuggest from the SEO guru that is Neil Patel is one of the best tools out there. As well as showing search volume and competition, you can see other information such as cost per click and the seasonality of the keyword. It’s free to use with no limitations at all, so is well worth checking out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ubersuggest-youtube-keywords.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="7-Google-trends"><a href="#7-Google-trends" class="headerlink" title="7. Google trends"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >Google trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>We would highly recommend investigating Google Trends as part of your YouTube keyword research, as it is powerful, accurate and, best of all, free! The options let you narrow down the trend results to just YouTube searches, which is great for gaining insights to your search terms. You can narrow down the results to a specific country too, helping you to gain insight into what your target demographic is currently interested in.</p><h4 id="8-VidIQ"><a href="#8-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="8. VidIQ"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The keyword tool in VidIQ is one of very few research tools that has a function for just YouTube built in. You can paste in the keywords you want to research, choose the country you wish to target, and it will return all the search volumes and amount of competition, and will score your keywords based on these figures.</p><p>On the downside, there is a fairly complicated subscription process to go through if you want to upgrade from the free version. To be honest, the free version is OK for new users, but for in depth analytics you’re going to want to upgrade eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-vidiq.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool VidIQ"                ></p><h4 id="9-Keyword-Keg"><a href="#9-Keyword-Keg" class="headerlink" title="9. Keyword Keg"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordkeg.com/youtube-keyword-tool.html" >Keyword Keg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Keyword Keg is definitely one of the most powerful YouTube keyword research tools out there. It offers lots of data, drawn from a variety of data sources including Wikipedia, Alibaba, Playstore and more. There are filters for country and language and you can drill down into issues like buyer intent and product info. However, as with most free YouTube keyword tools, there is a strict limit on what you can do before you pay. In this case, you only get to see the first five results unless you want to upgrade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-keywordkeg.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="10-Kparser"><a href="#10-Kparser" class="headerlink" title="10. Kparser"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://kparser.com/youtube-keyword-tool/" >Kparser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Kparser is a YouTube keyword tool that you should notice. You can use it to find YouTube keywords free to use. More than finding the best core keywords, this tool can also give you suggestions on long tail keywords in every field. By use this, you don’t need to worry that you can’t the right keywords to use in title, description and tags. You also can selcet country and language when searching a YouTube keyword. For searching more than one keyword, remember to seperate them with coma.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/kparser.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool Kparser"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords"><a href="#Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords"></a>Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords</h3><p>Getting your video ranking highly on YouTube is excellent and will certainly bring you more traffic. But, do you know what would be even better than that? Getting your video ranking on Google as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-video-result-keywords.jpg"                      alt="Google video result keywords"                ></p><p>To do this you’ll need to find ‘video result keywords’ in Google, so that yours can be one of the selected videos that sometimes show up in search. Google decides what should and shouldn’t trigger a video result, and usually shows them when a video would make sense, for example when someone asks ‘how to’ or searches for ‘cute’ or ‘funny’ things.</p><p>There’s a bit of trial and error involved as there is no YouTube keyword tool to find video result keywords… yet. But you can use Google to search your keywords and see if they are video result keywords. Just type them in, and if a video appears in the listings below, you’ve discovered a video result keyword that is well worth optimizing for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"

However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="list of tags for youtube"                ></p><p>That’s all there is to it.

It’s not as simple as the number of clicks your video gets. If someone sits and refreshes your video over and over without letting it play for any significant time, those refreshes won’t be recorded as views. There is a lot more that goes into the calculation.</p><ol><li><a href="#one">Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count</a></li><li><a href="#two">How Does YouTube Count Views</a></li><li><a href="#three">How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</a></li><li><a href="#four">Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</a></li><li><a href="#five">The Skip &amp; Skim</a></li><li><a href="#six">Frozen YouTube View Counts</a></li><li><a href="#seven">The 301 Mark</a></li></ol><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Video-Editor-Filmora"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Video-Editor-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Video Editor - Filmora"></a>Best YouTube Video Editor - Filmora</h2><p>After you have created your YouTube channel, do you want to edit videos and upload your first video? Here we recommend using Filmora to easily edit YouTube videos.</p><p>You can use Filmora to make YouTube videos with built-in royalty-free audio. Filmora also can help you make YouTube intros. It includes more than 500 templates, transitions, effects, and text resources.</p><h2 id="1-Not-Everyone-Who-Clicks-Adds-to-Your-View-Count"><a href="#1-Not-Everyone-Who-Clicks-Adds-to-Your-View-Count" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count"></a>1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count</h2><p>YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9" >full 30 seconds need to be viewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG"                      alt="how YouTube counts view"                ></p><h2 id="2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views"><a href="#2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does YouTube Count Views?"></a>2. How Does YouTube Count Views?</h2><p>YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.</p><p>Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.</p><p>At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.</p><p>You May Also Like:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > 5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work"><a href="#3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work" class="headerlink" title="3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?"></a>3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</h2><p>Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.</p><p>There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.</p><p>If you upload a video and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >set it as unlisted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.</p><p>You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.</p><p>However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.</p><p>We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.</p><p>Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.</p><h2 id="4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count"><a href="#4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count" class="headerlink" title="4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count"></a>4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</h2><p>Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.</p><p>One way that <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en" >YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).</p><p>Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.</p><h2 id="5-The-Skip-Skim"><a href="#5-The-Skip-Skim" class="headerlink" title="5. The Skip &amp; Skim"></a>5. The Skip &amp; Skim</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.</p><h2 id="6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts"><a href="#6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts" class="headerlink" title="6. Frozen YouTube View Counts"></a>6. Frozen YouTube View Counts</h2><p>Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.</p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/" >YouTube’s analytics reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.</p><h2 id="7-The-301-Mark"><a href="#7-The-301-Mark" class="headerlink" title="7. The 301 Mark"></a>7. The 301 Mark</h2><p>You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.</p><p>This is why view counts are often frozen at 301. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.</p><p>During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away" >YouTube says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t flag videos at 301 views anymore.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.</p><p>If you want to engage your audience with cool effects and Filmora is the best choice to make a split-screen and green screen video for YouTubers.

Smartphones have really great cameras, and you probably always have your phone with you. You can even post directly from your phone to YouTube!</p><h2 id="How-To-Make-YouTube-Videos-on-Your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#How-To-Make-YouTube-Videos-on-Your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone"></a>How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone</h2><p> Making a video on your smartphone is similar to making a video with any other camera in a lot of ways. There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Keep-It-Steady"><a href="#Part-1-Keep-It-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Be Heard"></a>Part 2. Be Heard</h4><p> You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tilt Your Phone"></a>Part 3. Tilt Your Phone</h4><p> When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.</p><p> The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems. With Filmora you can make awesome YouTube videos quickly using Filmora’s one-touch themes, or take a little bit more time personalizing your creation. One-touch themes are sets of related features, like filters and animated titles, which you can apply to your videos all at once. Filmora’s simple interface also makes it easy to apply filters, titles, overlays, transitions, and even royalty free music to your project one at a time.</p><p> After you’ve edited your video in Filmora you can post it directly to YouTube or other social media sites right from the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-exploring-youtubes-ownership-vs-cc-freedom-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring YouTube's Ownership Vs.

You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p><p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p><h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p><h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"                      alt="collab pitch examples"                ></p><p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Here are some more tips:</p><h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p><h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p><h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p><h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p><p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p><h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p><p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p><p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p><h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p><p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p><p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p><h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p><h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p><h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p><p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p><h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p><h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p><p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won’t make the person who’s done way more promotion feel great.</p><p> Have you ever collaborated on YouTube? If you could collaborate with anyone, who would it be and what kind of video would you make?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?"></a>1. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?</h4><p>There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.</p><h4 id="2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do"><a href="#2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do" class="headerlink" title="2. I want people to comment on my Private video. What should I do?"></a>2. I want people to comment on my Private video. What should I do?</h4><p>At the time of this writing, YouTube doesn’t allow anyone to post a comment on any video that has been set as ‘Private’. If your video is configured that way, you must change its nature to ‘Unlisted’, and share its link to the users before they can post a comment.</p><h4 id="3-How-can-I-block-certain-words-and-links-on-the-YouTube-comments"><a href="#3-How-can-I-block-certain-words-and-links-on-the-YouTube-comments" class="headerlink" title="3. How can I block certain words and links on the YouTube comments?"></a>3. How can I block certain words and links on the YouTube comments?</h4><p>You can go to <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Community</strong>, and on the <strong>Automated Filters</strong> tab in the right window, add the words to block in the <strong>Blocked words</strong> field. You can add multiple words by separating them with commas. To block the comments with links, check the <strong>Block links</strong> box. Click <strong>SAVE</strong> to save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/block-users-youtube-comment.jpg"                      alt=" Block YouTube   commnets "                ></p><h4 id="4-If-I-turn-comments-off-and-back-on-again-will-the-old-comments-come-back"><a href="#4-If-I-turn-comments-off-and-back-on-again-will-the-old-comments-come-back" class="headerlink" title="4. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?"></a>4. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?</h4><p>Yes. When you turn off the comments, the existing comments disappear. When you turn them back on, all the previous comments reappear, and become visible to the audience.</p><h4 id="5-If-I-change-my-comment-settings-will-the-existing-comments-be-impacted"><a href="#5-If-I-change-my-comment-settings-will-the-existing-comments-be-impacted" class="headerlink" title="5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?"></a>5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’.

Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p><h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p><p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p><p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p><p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p><p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p><p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p><p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p><p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p><p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p><h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p><p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"                      alt="pay per click"                ></p><p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p><p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click.

While the entire world is anxiously about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the football videos on YouTube are booming. In fact, the football-related searches on this platform have been soaring in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, despite the fact that some of the most popular football clubs in the world are still ignoring how powerful YouTube has become.</p><p>We have produced the infographic below which clearly shows how popular football videos are on YouTube, so let’s have a look at some of the mind-blowing facts we’ve discovered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/top-insights-into-football-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="top insights into football videos on youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Football-Content-Has-Never-Been-More-Popular-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#Football-Content-Has-Never-Been-More-Popular-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube"></a>Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube</h2><p>The football gods, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Neymar Jr are making enormous amounts of money, in addition to having an iconic status in the mass media. Such state of affairs explains why YouTube videos with these superstars saw an 80% increase in watch time over the course of the last year.</p><p>Interestingly, the highest amount of football-related searches on the world’s largest video sharing platform are coming from the South American and European countries. For example, France’s young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.</p><p>The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn’t nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.</p><p>Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira’s Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.</p><p>Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn’t include the actual gameplay.</p><p>As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.</p><h2 id="Are-Sports-the-Next-Big-Thing-On-YouTube-3"><a href="#Are-Sports-the-Next-Big-Thing-On-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?"></a>Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?</h2><p>At the moment, sports videos are growing faster than any other genre of videos you can find on YouTube, including entertainment or music, while the branded partnerships in this niche are growing 111% faster than all of the sports videos combined. The window of opportunity is clear for all brands that support sports activities.</p><p>Furthermore, brand ads for corporate giants such as Nike, Gatorade or Addidas attracted millions of views, which means that the leading brands in the world of sports have recognized YouTube as a marketplace they can no longer ignore.
