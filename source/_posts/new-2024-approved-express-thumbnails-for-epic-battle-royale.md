To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel.

### Option 3: Editing URL

This is among the least known method of creating a video loop. It involves editing the video URL of YouTube to replay. URL is usually divided in to different sections. This is the simplest option as involves only deleting the hypertext transfer protocol (https) and the World Wide Web (www) and inserting the word “repeat” immediately after “Youtube”.

This is how to do it:

**Step 1:** Search for the video to set on replay.

In our case, let’s choose - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc>

**Step 2:** Delete the first part “**<https://www.**”> in the address bar.

The remaining sections will be- youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc

**Step 3:** After “Youtube” and before “.com” write “repeat”.

So it looks like this “youtube**repeat**.com/watch/?v=xo1VInw-SKc” in your address bar.

**Step 4:** Click to play and your video will start playing in a loop in the ListenOnRepeat app.

![How to Loop YouTube Video: for Both Computer and Phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-loop-youtube-video-edit-url.jpg)
