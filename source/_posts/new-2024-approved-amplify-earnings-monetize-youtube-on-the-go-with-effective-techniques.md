However, the new YouTube Studio now allows you to trim, split video uploaded YouTube videos and add blur effects to faces or objects. Though this easy to use free online video editor doesn’t feature tools like combine several video clips, photos into one longer video, nor add Pan and Zoom effects like the previous version, you can still add audio tracks from its Audio Library to Video. Yeah, this is a video maker online with music and effects. So, it is in our best free online video editor list. Remember, if you’re looking for a free online video editor for YouTube for these simple editing features, then you can try the Editor under YouTube Studio.
