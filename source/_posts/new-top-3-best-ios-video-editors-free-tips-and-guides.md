## Part 2: How to Edit YouTube Videos on iPhone with the YouTube Studio Application

Being able to edit the videos you’ve uploaded to YouTube on your iPhone is without a doubt something very beneficial. The YouTube iOS application - YouTube Studio is a powerful mini video-editing tool. You can easily trim your video, add different effects and filters in order to prominently enhance the way that your video looks as well as to add music as a background and many more.

To edit videos with YouTube Studio, you need to upload the video footge first. To upload the video, navigate to the upper corner of your home screen, and click on the icon like a camera. Now that you can allow access to camera and go through and select your videos, you can easily take advantage of the three convenient tools.

You can **trim the beginning as well as the ending of the video** quickly, and you can select new start as well as end points. However, you wouldn’t be able to separate the clip in two different ones. Once you are through with that, you can easily **add different filter effects** through the filter option – there are six of them that you can take advantage of. Furthermore, you can easily **add background music**  by tapping on the music icon which is located in the lower-right part of your screen.

The YouTube Studio app might be a good idea, but it doesn’t provide you with all the necessary capabilities as it is rather limited.

As you can see, there are quite a lot of different ways to edit YouTube videos on iPhone and all you need to do is download a specific application or use the one which YouTube has built-in. There is no need for any previous specific knowledge or skills in video editing as they provide quite comprehensive features.
