## Bonus Tips to Create a Clickable YouTube Thumbnail

Don't know how to create a clickable youtube thumbnail? Here we will recommend 5 tips for you!

#### 1\. Great thumbnail image quality and size

The thumbnail image quality should be good (HD/UHD). It should be bright. No matter what the device (a large TV) the viewers are using, care must be taken to avoid getting blurry thumbnails. The quality and the correct size of the thumbnail will create a positive image of the video in the user’s mind even before viewing the video. The video must be viewed from a variety of devices to test if the quality differs in different devices. Here are some specs for a perfect thumbnail

* The image formats should be in GIF, JPG PNG OR BMP
* The maximum size of the image must be 1280\*720 px
* The minimum size 640\*360 px
* The aspect ratio 16:9
* The maximum file size 2MB

#### 2\. Show a person in the Thumbnail image

A human face will get you closer to your audience. Our brain is wired in a way that a human face will draw its attention more than anything. So the users will naturally would an image with a human delivering the content rather than a robot or just a video of nonliving things. People tend to find a connection with the characters displayed on the thumbnail and hence prompting them to click on the video.

#### 3\. Use descriptive text in your thumbnail with branding elements

It is not completely possible to deliver a message through a picture and hence try to use descriptive texts. The texts should be clear enough and must be phrased in a manner that increases the curiosity or appeals to the emotions of the viewers. People tend to click a video just because of curiosity, wanting to know what the content is about. The type of font, color, and size also plays an important role in catching the attention of the audience.

#### 4\. Make Color Contrast between the text and background

 Complementary colors will make your thumbnail stand out to some extent. Combining a yellow background with a purple foreground or green with red will make it easier to draw the attention of the browsers. Also, the use of analogous colors in the thumbnail makes it more attractive and pleasing to the eye.

Analogous colors are the colors that appear next to each other on a color wheel

#### 5\. Consistency

Consistency is something most of the people prefer and makes a thing more attractive. A thumbnail video with consistent text font, color tuning, visual effect, etc. will catch the eye of the users as it will stand apart in the whole webpage. Consistency adds to the standards of a video and will make people feel that this video is productive or from an authentic source
