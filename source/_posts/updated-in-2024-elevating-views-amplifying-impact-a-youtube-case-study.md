You’ve probably heard of stories about individuals who managed to find financial success on YouTube. If your dream is to [make money on YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it's important to remember that regular people are doing it.

Jesse Ridgway is the owner of the vlog [McJuggerNuggets](https://www.youtube.com/user/McJuggerNuggets), which has grown to over 3.4 million subscribers. He makes enough money to live off of YouTube alone. Here is a case study of how he made his first $10,000 on YouTube:

## Case Study of McJuggerNuggets

Jesse was one of the earliest YouTubers. He started his channel on December 9, 2006\. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:

#### AdSense

Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none) can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.

More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.

#### Target the Right Demographic

Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically. Think about who you want your audience to be and make videos that will appeal to them.

#### Multichannel Networks

Once you hit a certain level of subscribership and views you will start getting invited to MCMs. In some cases, multichannel network promotions could entitle you to discounts on merchandise and products. Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.

#### Social Blade

This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more. It will give you a good impression of what you should be including in your videos and how you can make more money from your channel.

#### Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time

Uploading videos at the right time will make sure that you are on the front page of recently uploaded videos when people are let out of school or taking a break from work. This will earn you lots of views. Set an upload time for all of your videos each day and stick to that schedule.

#### Check out Webinars

Looking into webinars and videos of what other popular YouTube experts have done will help you model their success.

#### Collaborate with Other YouTubers

When you create a collab video you and your partner are each introduced to each other’s subscribers.

#### Keep Quality Up

Putting time and effort into every upload will ensure that you won’t lose subscribers or viewers because you got a bit lazy.

#### Do Follow-Up Videos

If you have a particular video that has a lot of views, you may want to consider creating follow-up videos. This can be a great way to generate lots of views.

#### Complete Regular Research

Regular research into your target market will help you to create the trendiest new content.

#### Don't Get Discouraged

Timing and luck are definitely two of the biggest factors in becoming a success on YouTube. If you are willing to keep working and don’t get discouraged you will eventually earn profits.
