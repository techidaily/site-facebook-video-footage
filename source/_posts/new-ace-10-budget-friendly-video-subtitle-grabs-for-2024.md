## Top Features about YouTube App (especially for YouTube Creators, not for Viewers)

 If you wish to learn more about the YouTube app for iPhone or YouTube app for Android, check out the following features:

#### 1.Sync all of your devices

 First and foremost, it is worth pointing out that YouTube app is able to sync all of your devices. In this way, you do not need to worry about having YouTube installed on multiple devices. You can use the app on either one of these devices in the most efficient manner. In fact, you can choose which account you are going to use, should you have multiple Google accounts and hence multiple YouTube accounts.

#### 2.Rich resources

 When you upload videos from the app, you can apply music or special filters to make the most of their looks. When it comes to music, there is a rich in-built library that allows you to browse through some truly great audio tracks. If you find something you like, you can use it to add style and character to your uploaded video. There is the option to preview the changes and conclude as to whether or not they appeal to you before posting.

#### 3.Editing features

 Using the editing features available on the app, you can fully customize the way your video looks in the end. You can apply a plethora of different filters, which will offer you the chance to better control the final outcome. By constantly previewing the video, you have total control over what your video is going to look like in the end. When you sue that feature prior to uploading the video, it can save you from a lot of trouble and unnecessary work.

#### 4.Quickly check out any updates

 All the channels you have subscribed to will appear horizontally, allowing you to quickly check out any updates. In this way, you do not need to waste any time trying to search through the various channels and see what they have been up to. This will save you a great deal of time and effort, while it will alert you without any delay about new releases.

#### 5.Minimize a video during your ongoing research

 Another cool feature that will help you out a great deal is the option of minimizing a video during your ongoing research on YouTube app for Android and iPhone. This means that you can still listen to the song and run your search using the app. The feature can be proven exceptionally practical to many people who have been used to interrupting their music for the sake of another search.

 With an equally cool feature, you can combine the amazing nature of the YouTube app for iPhone or Android along with your new Smart TV. There is a special command on the menu of your app that enables you to watch the videos on your TV. So this will give you the opportunity to enjoy high-quality music on a much bigger screen.

 Last but not least, you can always use the Watch Later button to catch up on videos that you do not have the time to enjoy right away. Whether you have already started watching them and turn out to take longer than expected or you have not checked them out yet, you can add them to your watch list and ensure they are ready when you need them.

 YouTube app for Android and YouTube app for iPhone can truly help you out a lot. There are multiple features that improve your user experience and assist you to optimize the videos you are uploading. You can benefit from many different features and music applied to your original video, while you can also enjoy great features adding to the convenience when watching videos. Overall, the app is a great addition to your smartphone and can be of unique assistance to you editing-wise.
