##### Using A Script

Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:

Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.

setInterval(function () { document.querySelector('#primary button\[aria-label="Action menu"\]').click(); var things = document.evaluate( '//span\[contains(text(),"Remove from")\]', document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED\_NODE\_SNAPSHOT\_TYPE, null ); for (var i = 0; i < things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);
