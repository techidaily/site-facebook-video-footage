The video description is the text below each video. Adding descriptions to your videos is not required. However, if you want success on YouTube, we highly recommend paying attention to video descriptions. It will give viewers more context about the video and will convince them to watch it.

### YouTube Channel Description

![example of a channel description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-description-templates-description-sample.JPG)

This is the text on your About page. It explains to your visitors what your channel is all about. What can they expect from you? You should put this information in your channel description. It's how you can get discovered by people looking for content exactly like what you offer. Basically, your channel description is like an ad. It tells other users why they should subscribe to your channel.

## Tips for Creating an Amazing YouTube Description

YouTube is not only telling people that they should watch your content. It also tells YouTube to recommend the video to users searching for something to watch. YouTube crawls the description to rank your videos in search results. That said, you must do it right. Here are some tips you should keep in mind.

1. Include the most important keywords in your video description.
2. Inform viewers what to expect from the video. What is it about? Is it a travel blog, food review, or what?
3. Add relevant hashtags to your video description.
4. Add links (relevant resources, your socials, timestamps, links to your other videos, etc.)
5. Ensure the hook is attention-grabbing. Otherwise, people would ignore it and your video altogether.
6. Add a call-to-action to remind your viewers to like and subscribe.
7. Note that only the first 200 characters will appear on the screen. Users need to click the "Show More" button to view the rest. So put what's most important in the first 200 characters.

### Benefits of Using a YouTube Description Templates

### **Factors** **That Influence Earnings**

The amount of money you make on YouTube Shorts is not fixed. It will depend on several factors, including the revenue channel and your interactions with viewers

* **Ad revenue:** A higher view count on Shorts increases ad revenue from the ads that are between Shorts on the platform.
* **Viewer engagement:** Viewer engagement brings in additional revenue through features like Super Thanks.
* **Number of monetized Shorts:** Monetizing most of your short-form videos will increase the revenue generated.
* **Shopping Revenue:** How well you promote your products and the set price point of the products will determine the shopping revenue generated.

### **Examples of Creators Who Have Earned from Shorts**
