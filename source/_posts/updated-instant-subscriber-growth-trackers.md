There are many components that are important for the success of your YouTube channel, but none of them are as [important as subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html).

Your subscriber count will tell you how well your channel is doing. Understanding who your audience is will enable you to come up with the content for your channel that is more perfectly suited to the tastes of the majority you’re your subscribers. Even though YouTube allows you to see who your subscribers are, monitoring the sub count in real time requires the use of subscriber trackers or counters ([more interested in seeing exactly who your subscribers are?](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/see-all-your-subscribers-on-youtube---easy-297.html)).

If you would like to keep track of the ever-changing number of subscribers to your channel, or gather information such as the sub counts and views of other YouTube channels, then using a live subscriber counter is a good choice.

Here are the top 12 YouTube subscriber counters:

* [Social Blade](#socialblade)
* [Subscribercounter.com](#subscribercounter)
* [Akshatmittal.com](#akshatmittal)
* [LiveCounts.net](#livecounts)
* [Grin.co](#grin)
* [YouCount.github.io](#youcount)
* [RealTimeSubCount.com](#realtimesubcount)
* [SubscriberCount.org](#subscribercount)
* [Live.SumScreen.com](#livesumscreen)
* [YTCount.com](#ytcount)
* [Realtime Subscriber Count](#realtimesubscriber)
* [Realtime Sub Count](#realtimesub)

## Top 12 Best YouTuber Subscriber Trackers You Should Use

### 1. [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/realtime)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker - Social Blade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-social-blade.jpg)

This is probably the best tool you can use to monitor how the number of subscribers to any YouTube channel changes in from second to second. What's more, Social Blade allows you to compare up to three different YouTube channels and you can also keep track of the number of subscribers top channels on YouTube have. In addition, you will be able to see how many videos they have uploaded and how many views they got. To start monitoring sub counts live via Social Blade simply enter the name of a channel and let the algorithm do the rest.

### 2. [Subscribercounter.com](https://subscribercounter.com/channel/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker Subscribercounter.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-subscribercounter.jpg)

This website doesn't provide advanced statistics, but it is easy to use. If all you need to find out the number of subscribers of a channel, insert the channel's name into the search box. The search results also include the number of videos featured on the YouTube channel as well as the number of views. Subscriber Counter is an easy-to-use tool, but just don't expect much more than basic information from this live subscriber tracker.

### 3. [Akshatmittal.com](https://akshatmittal.com/)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Akshatmittal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-akshatmittal.jpg)

The users of this tool can get the accurate number of subscribers for any YouTube channel in real time and they are also granted an insight into the number of views and comments a channel has received and how many videos are uploaded to it. Channel username, channel ID, YouTube URL can all be used as search terms on Askat Mittal's YouTube Real-time subscriber counter.

A fringe bonus of Askat Mittal’s service is that the information is all displayed beautifully alongside the channel art of the YouTubers you look up.

### 4. [LiveCounts.net](https://livecounts.net/channel/filmora.io)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: livecounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-livecounts.jpg)

If you are in need of an easy-to-use YouTube subscriber counter, then LiveCounts is a strong option. However, if you want to learn more about a YouTube channel than its subscriber count, such as the number of videos a creator has uploaded, how many views they have received, or how many comments their videos have, then LiveCounts may not be a good choice since it only monitors subscriber numbers in real time. There is a views tool, but it does not appear to be working.

On LiveCounts you can change the color of the display background.

### 5. [Grin.co](https://grow.grin.co/live-youtube-subscriber-count/filmora.io)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Grin.co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-grin-io.jpg)

Grin.co is a California-based company that provides services for marketers has designed a perfect sub count tool that enables you to know the exact number of subscribers for any YouTube account. Furthermore, this easy to use real-time subscriber counter allows you to share the latest statistics about your YouTube's leading channel easily to Facebook or Twitter. You can either search the channels by entering the user or a channel name into the search bar.

### 6. [YouCount.github.io](https://youcount.github.io/)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: YouCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-youcount.jpg)

YouTube creators in need of an advanced real-time subscriber count tool will without a doubt benefit from YouCount. Besides a live subscriber counter, YouCount also provides advanced statistics such as real-time trends with a 30-second refresh rate as well as information about total views or the number of videos the channel you are researching features.

Some of the more unique tools on YouCount allow you to compare a channel’s recent success (the statistics of the last 5 videos posted there) with the popularity of the channel as a whole. This is a good way to see if a channel is picking up momentum.

### 7. [RealTimeSubCount.com](https://realtimesubcount.com/#!/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: RealTimeSubCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-realtimesubcount.jpg)

Getting real-time statistics from the YouTube Subscriber Count is easy because all you need to do in order to get an exact number of subscribers for your channel, or any other YouTube channel, is to type the channel's name into the search box. There is also an app for Android Smartphones available if you like to work on your smartphone. The version of the app for iPhones should become available in the near future.

### 8. [SubscriberCount.org](https://www.subscribercount.org/filmoraio)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: SubscriberCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/SubscriberCount-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

Information like the number of video uploads, views, and the creation date of the YouTube channel are all easily accessible via the SubscriberCount website. Simply insert the name or the URL of the channel you'd like to find out more about and enjoy the benefits. After you've made your search query the website will automatically suggest similar YouTube channels which can be a great way to discover new channels and find interesting content.

### 9.  Live.SumScreen.com

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: SubscriberCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/live-sum-screen-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

You can either insert the name (or the ID sequence from the channel’s URL if the channel doesn’t have a custom URL) of the channel into the search bar on the website's welcome screen and be just one click away from real-time subscriber counts.

\[Update August 21, 2018: Live.SumScreen tracker feature is currently unavailable\]

### 10. [YTCount.com](https://www.ytcount.com/web/filmora.io/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA/)

![YT Count YouTube Subscribers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YTCount-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

This is a website that offers an app you can use on your[iPhone, iPad or iPad Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ytcount-subscriber-count/id1091736385?mt=8), or even on your [Android smartphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ytcount). All versions of the app are free to download and allow you to follow several YouTube channels simultaneously, receive a notification every time you reach a milestone, and customize the app however you want. YT Count will enable you to analyze the statistics of any YouTube channel and monitor the latest changes in real-time.

### 11. [Realtime Subscriber Count](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/realtime-subscriber-count/jgfaljbminhalkeonllnkfeacehcgkdi?hl=en-GB)

![Realtime Subscriber Count](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/realtime-subscriber-count-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

Although remarkably easy to use this Google Chrome extension doesn't offer much more than basic statistics, such as the current number of subscribers or the number of videos the channel features. YouTubers who are looking for more advanced analysis of data should look elsewhere because this extension doesn't provide any additional information. Realtime Subscriber Count is a great way to keep track of subscriber numbers while you browse, but that is all it can do.

### 12. [Realtime Sub Count](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sub-count/id977966794?platform=iphone&preserveScrollPosition=true#platform/iphone)

![YouTube Sub Count app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/realtime-sub-count-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

The Realtime Sub Count app is only available for iOS devices. This app was launched in April 2017 and, even though it provides some detailed information, it is still under development. If you decide to download this app you will be able to save your favorite channels and always get accurate data for them. The app updates every two seconds.
