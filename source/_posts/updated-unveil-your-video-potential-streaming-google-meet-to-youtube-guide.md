## Bonus: Will YouTube auto-subscribe me to a new channel?

It is not necessarily true that YouTube auto-subscribe will subscribe to a new channel. However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.

• Spinoff Channel  
A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.

• Check your extensions  
One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser's settings and make the "Unsubscribe" option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.

• Someone else can hit the button  
Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the "Subscribe" button without your consent. Just unsubscribe and keep watching next time.

## Conclusion

● The internet arena is very competitive. It would be best if you did everything right to drive as many YouTube auto-subscribers as possible to your channel. And creating a YouTube auto-subscribe link is the first step to making things easier for your potential subscribers.
