## Part 3: How to Outline a Person in a YouTube Thumbnail with Photoshop

Because YouTube thumbnails are nothing but static images, creating **YouTube thumbnail border** with Adobe Photoshop is comparatively easier. The process of doing this is given below:

**Step 1: Define Document Preferences and Import an Image**

Launch Adobe Photoshop on your PC, click **Create new**, and on the **New Document** customization box, define the width and height values to **1280** and **720** pixels respectively. Select **Transparent** from the **Background Contents** menu as well if not already selected. Click **Create** from the bottom to create a new Photoshop document with the specified document settings. Next, open the folder that contains the source image, drag the photo to Photoshop, and press **Enter** to place the photo.

![import thumbnail image to ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-youtube-thumbnail-photoshop.jpg)

**Step 2: Remove Background from the Image**

Make sure that the image layer is selected in the **Layers** panel on the right, go to **Select** from the menu bar at the top, and click **Subject**. From the bottom of the **Layers** panel, click the **Add a mask** icon to get rid of the background, leaving only the human on the Canvas.

![remove thumbnail background in ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-thumbnail-background.jpg)

**Step 3: Add a Custom Background and an Outline Around the Subject**

Use the method explained earlier to import a background image of your choice to Photoshop. Drag the background image layer to the bottom in the **Layers** panel. Double-click the masked layer, click to select **Stroke** from the left pane of the **Layer Style** box, and use the options available on the right to manage the size, color, position, etc. of the stroke that has been added around the human subject. Click **OK** when done, and then export the image normally to use it as a **YouTube thumbnail border**.

**Summary**

It is important to know that the default resolution of a YouTube thumbnail is 1280 x 720 pixels that is usually written and referred to as 720p. While adding a **YouTube thumbnail border**, it is also imperative to have a good sense of color combination and fonts. Furthermore, a decent tool like Wondershare Filmora X must be used to add an appealing **neon border** around the main subject in the thumbnail image easily and quickly.

For macOS 10.12 or later

**Step 1: Define Project Settings and Add Image to the Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora X on your PC (a MacBook Pro M1 is used here), ensure that the project aspect ratio is set to **16:9 (Widescreen)** on the splash screen, and click **New Project**. On the main interface, click the **Preview quality and display settings** icon from the upper-right area of the Timeline, click **Change Project Aspect Ratio**, click to select **1280 x 720 (HD)** from the **Resolution** menu of the **Project Settings** box, and click **OK** to save the custom project settings.

![Filmora Mac start interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-mac-start-interface.jpg)

Then select **My Media** from the menu bar if not already selected, click **Project Media** from the navigation pane, and click **Import** from the **Media** box to select and import the image of the main character or object that you want to use in the thumbnail.

![Import videos to Filmora  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-change-aspect-ratio-filmora.jpg)

Now, drag the image from the **Media** box to the Timeline at the bottom.

**Step 2: Clear Image Background, Add Border, and Add Custom Background**

Go to **Effects** from the menu bar, click to select the **Default** tab and then **AI Portrait** from the navigation pane, and click and drag the **Human Segmentation** preset from the right box, and place it over the image track in the Timeline.

![add human segmentation effect to youtube thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-segmentation-remove-background.jpg)

Double-click the image layer, scroll down the upper-left box to the **Video Effects** section, and use the **Edge Thickness** and **Edge Feather** sliders to adjust the characterâ€™s edges to make them as realistic as possible. Click **OK** when done.

Next, click and drag the **Human Border** preset over the image track in the Timeline, and follow the same procedure to customize the border. This will give the character a **neon border** effect.

![adjust thumbnail border settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-border-effects.jpg)

Now, use the method explained earlier to import a custom image for the background, and drag and place it under the previous track in the Timeline.

![adjust border to photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-photo-to-border.jpg)

**Note:** You can use any of the tools available online to remove the background from your image for free.

![upload thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-thumbnail-canva.jpg)

To add a **YouTube thumbnail border**, make sure that the image that you added to the Canvas is selected, click the **Duplicate** icon from the upper-right area, and use the scaling handles of the copy of the image to increase its size a bit. Reposition the image back to its original location as well.

Then, click **Edit image** from the upper-left corner of the Canvas, click **Duotone** from the **Edit image** pane at the center, if need be, click **See all**, choose your preferred duotone effect to apply on the image, choose your preferred highlight and shadow colors from the box that appears next, and click **Back** from the top of the pane.
