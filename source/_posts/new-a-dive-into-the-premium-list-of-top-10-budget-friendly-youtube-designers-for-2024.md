However, Fotojet isn't a free platform, even though the free trial period is available (we include it on this list because the trial period would be enough for a lot of people to get their channel art done).

Unlike most of the online design tools that we have previously mentioned, in PicMonkey, you can toggle between layers like you can in PhotoShop, select from a variety of blending options, and you also have the ability to draw and erase. In this entire list, it’s the closest tool you’ll get to PhotoShop.
