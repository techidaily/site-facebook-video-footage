**Step 1**: At first when you begin you need to do some research to find out which hashtags have quality videos based on the content type.

**Step 2**: Then choose a minimum of 3 hashtags to the end of your description in your video and add them.

**Step 3**: Once you are done with adding save your description. Here the added hashtags would appear as a blue link.

**Step 4**: Lastly, you need to click on save and check your title to see if they show up above it.

That's it! It's done!
