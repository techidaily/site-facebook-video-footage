* [**Part 3: 5 Video Effects to Help You Create a Stunning YouTube Outro**](#part3)

## Part 1: What is an Outro?

Still, wondering what is the outro meaning? Simply put, an outro is the closing part of your video content. YouTube outros appear at the end of your video and act as a wrap-up for your content. Without a suitable outro, videos are likely to appear abrupt and rushed. Creating a proper outro helps create a clean and appropriate finishing and also helps to increase engagement with the audience.

![example of youtube outro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-1.jpg)

A YouTube outro can serve other functions as well, such as prompting the viewers for certain actions. You can add a call-to-action button, links to websites, or other suggested content at the end screen of your video. Other content that can be included in a YouTube outro can be:

Suggested Videos/Playlists: A link to recommended videos or playlists.

Website Links: Links to an external website.

Subscribe Prompt: Ask the viewer to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

Channel Links: Attached link to a different channel on YouTube.

## Part 2: How to Create Outstanding YouTube Outro?

Want to know how to make an outro for your YouTube video? YouTube outros can serve numerous purposes to the user when done right. Let's look at the important elements of a perfectly comprised YouTube outro and how you can create one from scratch.

### Things to Consider

Following are some important things that you might need to consider while making an outro for YouTube:

* **Technical Specifications**

Ideally, a YouTube outro should be in the aspect ratio of 16:9\. Keep the resolution of your outro maintained at 1920x1080 pixels. Also, ensure that the outro appears on the screen for up to eight seconds or longer, depending upon the length of your video.

* **Simplicity**

Your YouTube outros do not need to be over the top and flowing with creative elements. Choose a simple and elegant design that does not clutter the screen.

* **Empty Spaces**

Like all other digital designs, make sure that your YouTube outro has plenty of white spaces so elements do not appear crowded and distracting.

* **Appropriate CTAs**

If you are using CTAs in your outro, remember to add links and elements that are relevant. Your call-to-action buttons should be related to the video and should make sense to the viewer.

* **Consistency**

Being consistent in your designs is a key ingredient to improving your brand recognition. Stick to a specific color palette or themes, so the audience can easily identify your channel.

### How to Make an Outstanding YouTube Video Outro

Now it is time to learn how to make an outro for YouTube. You can create the perfect outro for YouTube using the tools from Adobe After Effects. The following steps indicate how to make an outro using After Effects:

Step 1: Pre-Process Preparation

Launch After Effects and import the files you want in your end screen, such as logos of social media platforms.

Step 2: Create a Composition

Create a new composition on After Effects. Set the resolution to 1920x1080, the duration to 10 seconds or according to your requirements, and click on "OK."

![finalize the composition settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-2.jpg)

Step 3: Create a Background Layer

Go to the "Layer" tab, tap "New," create a black "Solid" background layer.

![background layer creation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-3.jpg)

Step 4: Add Video Suggestion Box

Now grab the "Rectangle Tool" and create a new shape on the right side of the screen, which will serve as a video suggestion box. You can create multiple shapes if you want to add more than one video suggestion.

![video suggestion box added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-4.jpg)

Step 5: Add Subscribe Button

Next, go to the shape tool again and select the "Ellipse Tool." Deselect the current shape layer to create a new one and create a circle on the left part of the screen, which will act as your Subscribe button.

![subscribe button added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-5.jpg)

Step 6: Add Effects

Now highlight the shape layers again by shift. Right-click and add "Layer Styles" such as an "Outer Glow." Expand the settings, and you can change the color of your glow. Also, increase the opacity and blending mode of that as well as the size and strength.

![effects added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-6.jpg)

Step 7: Customize Background

From the "Effects and Preset" panel, you can add different "Animation Presets" to your background. Choose one that you like and drag it on the layer.

![customize your background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-7.jpg)

Step 8: Add Text and Icons

Now add text to your YouTube outros like your social media handles or any other information that you want. Grab the text tool from the top and add a text.

![add text or icons in the design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-8.jpg)

If you want to add other logos or PNGs like social media icons, you can drag and drop them into their layer and place them on the composition.

Step 9: Export and Upload

Go to the "Composition" tab and select "Add to Render Queue." Press "Render." You can attach that clip to the end of any video or project. When you upload your video to YouTube, press "Edit Video" and go to "End Screen and Annotations." Here you can add different elements such as the subscribe button or the most recent uploads.
